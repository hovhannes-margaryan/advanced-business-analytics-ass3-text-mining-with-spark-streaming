I have been apart of tons of MMO launches over the years and problems happen, but these guys take days to communicate the issues, and this is just unprofessional.

Customizing your ruler is awesome. making your banner with color option, insignia options is just a refreshing. Warhammer I understand follows a ""Lore"" but I like being my own story and settling where I want. This game allows me to do just that. The tomes are an awesome research tool and so fun to go through them all. This game doesnt make me feel pressured, when someone declares war I dont feel like I have to struggle to get units to get ready or anything. This game is awesome all the way around.

0,138235975,1940340,"Overall I've found the game to be a disappointment. The flow of the first game has been abandoned for a Hades-esque format where you're in a constant restart loop. Instead of the first game where you are simply dropped in and left to figure it out you are now spoon fed access to everything on a slow drip as EVERYTHING is gated behind shops to be unlocked. 

The maps themselves are also a huge step backwards. The suspense of each unscouted tile being a trap or encounter as you inch forward is gone. There is exactly one event between ""rooms"" now and you always have a choice between paths now. Because there are no true surprises waiting for you you spend a lot of time just waiting for your cart to plod down the path. I find a large part of the gameplay is just spent waiting and wishing I had a turbo button to get through the constant repetition. All the fun dialogue and character interactions to take the edge off of the repetition in Hades is completely absent here. 

I've generally found the UI to be a mess. From the outset I was just met with confusion. The frequency with which there are icons on screen that you can't hover over for a tooltip is way too high. Far too much of the information requires holding additional buttons CTRL or ALT to access stuff which isn't always accessible depending on what screen or event you're on. The games ability to present information during the natural flow of gameplay is poor. 

Skill unlocks are slow going and make it impossible to evaluate characters or comps early on. Nor is there a way I've found to determine in game what order you unlock things or even what you unlock until you've committed to a shrine. Having an endless list of things that require candles but having little way of determining what should or should not be prioritized because it's all obfuscated is a major complaint. A prime offender I found was the class paths. Switching from Wanderer to Confessor for the first time. It simply says ""Rank Flexible roll that specializes in debuff and token removal."" It's just flavor text to give you a vague idea of what it does instead of simply presenting you with the changes. They've bothered to add a list of the skills effected by the path but not to add tool tips to view the changes and evaluate before purchase. All trinkets and items have been relegated to individual unlock. No indication if it's ordered progression or just random.

The presentation is a step up. The game does look better and I found myself enjoying the 3d transition far more than expected as my initial reaction to it was rather negative. The animations as characters move between ranks to be an excellent addition that brings life to the combat.

The actual combat remains mostly the same as DD1. Debuffs no longer last for some amount of time but instead are consumed when they are rolled for. Blind for instance gives you a 50% chance to miss on your next attack and will stick around until you make an attack so you can't just wait it out by using support skills and I've enjoyed the change. Stress is triggers affliction or virtue at 10 and resets instead of trigger at 100 and heart attack at 200.  Instead of having a myriad of different affects for Afflictions and Virtues we now only get good or bad. You either lose a bunch of health and get negative relationship points or you get a big heal and gain relationship points. So far I've found the relationship system to be pretty obnoxious with little way of interacting with it. Hopefully that changes later in the game as more items/trinkets are unlocked to interact with relationship points. 

Overall I'm pretty unhappy with most out of combat changes and the relationship system. I'd have much preferred they stick to the format that made DD1 so successful and continue to build on that. I think the Hades approach has detracted from what made the first one special.",0
0,138235684,1940340,"Very fun, less grind than DD1 and every run is a new challenge. High recommend if you like roguelikes",1

0,138235164,1940340,"(300+ hours on DD1)

This isn't a game-play sequel, this is a story sequel.

The combat has been updated and improved since DD1. The new game-play loop is both more engaging AND rewarding. losses aren't the same, but having a party member die is still devastating at times.

The candle system is basic, but passable. 

I'm highly enjoying the game.",1
0,138235085,1940340,"Hi there,
as many of you i am a great fan of the first game.
As many of you, i immediately felt something is off in this second chapter.
While in the first game you had to slowly build your town and your heroes to eventually enter the final dungeon, in DD2 you just embark on an expedition with 4 characters, and once that expedition is over, you go for the next one.
You dont' get to keep your heroes, you dont' get to keep any trinkets, you don't keep anything. After finishing a run (either beating the boss or team whipe) you get an amount of candles that you can spend to make your future runs easier.
This is still something, as it gives some sense of satisfaction, but after a dozen of runs it already started to feel annoying.
One of the best aspect of the first game was the care and attention you needed to give to your characters: you had your favourites one, with their perks you spent hours and gold to get, with your preferred trinkets choice. It was a great feeling venturing forth with your veterans knowing that yes, with them you had a slight edge on enemies, but things could still end up in disaster. All this feeling is now gone: sometimes if a run is disappointing me (i.e. bad perks, bad relationship) i just find  it's better to end it there. I get my candles, i start a new one and hope for the best. I think this defies the very essence of the 1st game, where no matter what you struggled to get the best ouf of every dungeon expedition, because you spent gold, time, resources on that run and on those caracters.
The graphic is now good, but i find this game as A LOT of dead moments: the combat animations takes so long, riding the carriage is pointless because you just have to press W and wait for the next encounter.
The core gameplay is still solid: combat is fun and brutal
Art direction is still on point, but even in this case something is off: it's weird that every run has the same scenarios put together in a random order. It makes it seems like there's no real sense around the story: what are theese scenarios? Why the city is in flame? Why the hell am i going toward the mountain?
I'm playing the game, i think it's ok, but the price was too high (even with the discount, i feel 30 bucks for a downgrade of the 1st game is way too much).
I feel like the devs tried to make this more appealing to a larger fane base: i hope this will give them the means to make something great in the future, but i also feel like the original fanbase was a bit ignored.
If you are new to DD, maybe this could be a good way to start getting involved. Other than that, play the first one.

0,138236569,1159690,"I find it very exhausting to always have to gather loot and smelt everything, then use the research table to make a blueprint and after, gather the rescourses and build it. This game have A LOT to craft and most of this becomes more and more expensive. I have spent most of my time really only smelting and gathering loot rather than do whats really fun, fighting and building my own custom train. 

My train right now is just a long organized ''mess'' because the storage chest are very small and the bigger ones are more expensive and kinda not really worth it in my opinion. You also need to have the different worktables, smelters, labs in each stage. You can't remove smelter 1 and only use 2. Thats what I thought because it would make sense to make that better and faster, but not really, it is just another smelter that let you smelt something different that you would later need.

So right now, I can play the game in 20-30 minutes intervalls because I get so exhausted always have to loot, smelt, wait, craft, research, wait, craft and boom. The engine is also very expensive and does not go fast for a long time. Also everything gets damaged very fast and some are a bit too expensive to repair. 

The winch system with the hooks could be more frequent and faster, now it feels ''blocky'' and kinda off. I was kinda hoping for a seamless spiderman feel but it feels more of something thats really not finish.

The game is quite okay and a lowkey meh, in my opinion. I see a lot of potential in this game but right now it is more boring and meh faster than actually fun, it is just too much to do and craft for a very long period.

Right now the game is more suitable for multiplayer than singleplayer.
Would I recommend this game to other players? I would say yes and no, it really depends. I couldn't leave something in the middle so I went with yes, I can really tell that they have been working hard on this game.",1
0,138234967,1159690,It is a great game to play with friends. Has some grind but gets better as you go. Very atmospheric. There are some bugs since it just came out but the devs are on it.,1
0,138234759,1159690,"4 hours in and I'm having more fun than in most survival games I've played. The multiplayer and epic games linking have issues, but the devs seem to be patching fast.

The graphics are good
The narrator and story are interesting.
The gameplay is fun and engaging.
World and creatures are cool.
Gunplay and combat is a little lacking, it feels clunky, and so does the UI around combat and enemies. Devs have already made a note to improve it, and it's honestly not a deal-breaker.

As it stands, the bugs and clunky gunplay hinder what is an otherwise entertaining and new take on survival games. Nevertheless, it's still enjoyable and feels fresh!

The bad : it's still only mediocre and suffers from bad balancing. 

Constant animal attacks interrupt everything (while setting up an ambush on a base I got attacked by no less than 12 alligators. Even when you shoot them with a silencer it still alerts all guards. Happened 4 times in 10 hours of gameplay so far.)
Combat is boring. The game doesn't like stealth/sniping, as it tries very hard to make it as frustrating as possible. All too often, it ends in bang-boom-bang-explosions-everywhere. The available weapons are very much geared towards that. Which means that 80/90% of them are plain useless for a sniper.

As usually there are way too many and too long cutscenes, but that's just FC.

0,138236955,2369390,"Why though? It's good to find a formula people recognize and enjoy. It's good to create a somewhat new storyline and concept to be the backing to all the gaming going on. It's good to try to innovate new ideas into your game. ...But which one of you mooks said, 'You know what this game needs? No healing items! We'll just make it so the player can only heal over time, and has to regnerate their heal charges, which will be all sorts of over the top animations, like using pliers to rip the fresh slugs from their flesh!'? Who said, 'You know those jetski races we had? You know what they need? MINES IN THE WATER. And you know what else? Lets retool the way they handle to be twice as slippery as before, steer from the back instead of the front, and only either be full throttle or barely moving! Egh? EGH?!' Who felt the game shouldn't start at the beginning, and instead require you to play through an extra long introductory cutscene before the game started... and then give you absolutely everything everywhere to do at once? Who's ideas were these? BECAUSE THEY'RE HORRIBLE IDEAS. 
As soon as I reached the 'beginning' of the game, I was buried in stuff and lost. I had races against time; except they had enemy troops at the end after beating them that then swarmed me to death, resetting it all. I had missions come up as I was trying to return to the starting point (why didn't you just allow someone doing this quest to restart at the starting point? Why some random, far off location that was almost guaranteed to pull them off and sidetrack them?) and then those missions escalated to the point of me having to lay hidden in a bush from special forces for 20 minutes (I wasn't going to do the mission; I just peeked in the seemingly empty area, only for it to explode with enemies, and helicopters and snipers with perfect aim who were also completely in cover).
I admit that maybe I was a little tired as I played, but I was having decent fun playing the beginning. Then suddenly I couldn't find any focus; not the main thread of the story, not hunting, not farming resources, NOTHING... because every time I turned around once and tried to focus, my radio would go off again. 'Can you do THIS!? Can you do THAT?! I know I gave you five freakin other starter missions that are going to require you to liberate the entire map... but can ya?!' The 'race' was the icing that made me write this negative review cake though. I made the first few turns, and was wondering where the mines were as I coasted through. Then I realized ALL of those yellow orbs in the water were mines. ALL of them. Where the hell did they get all those mines?! And they all one shot you too! So if you make one mistakes, race over, start from the beginning? Aw, HEELLLL naw!
The game, on the surface, is fun. I LOVED Far Cry Primal and Far Cry New Sawn, and was eager for more in a new world, with maybe some new story and cutscenes. And now I'm going to have to teach myself to not look away from the main quests or I'm going to regret it.Or is it maybe stop trying to look at the main quests?  There comes a point in a game where just layering the difficulty does nothing for the game, and this feels like that; like the devs or producers tried to cram all the MORE into the game, and left it almost too full of things that need doing.",0

I began this game on realistic difficulty with all of the assists turned off, and although it's been very challenging, the learning process has actually been quite fun. This particular game requires so much concentration that I've found it to be incredibly easy to lose myself in it, and because of that I've found this to be very relaxing to just zone out to.

Though I do recommend this game, there are two things I don't like about it. The scenery in this game kind of flickers as you go by and it can be incredibly distracting. I've adjusted my settings multiple times and have yet to mitigate this issue. There's also ZERO customization in this game, you have a list of professional racers to choose from and that's who you will play as throughout the season.

Aside from the two things listed above, this game is solid. This is my first sportbike game in ages and it's been humbling to play. Find me on Twitch if you'd like to see me struggle to go fast. xD",1

4. Spread the Dijon mustard over the cooled beef tenderloin.
5. In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, shallots, and garlic and cook until the mushrooms are browned and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
6. Add the white wine, beef broth, and thyme to the skillet and cook until the liquid has reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
7. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mushroom mixture cool.
8. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
9. Spread the mushroom mixture over the puff pastry.
10. Place the beef tenderloin on top of the mushroom mixture.
11. Wrap the puff pastry around the beef tenderloin, making sure to seal the edges.
12. Brush the beaten egg over the top of the puff pastry.
13. Place the Beef Wellington on a baking sheet and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the puff pastry is golden brown and the beef tenderloin is cooked to your liking.
14. Let the Beef Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

The Atmosphere is great, you get to meet your fans and they come in all shapes and sizes, some cheering you on, others wanting a Autograph that they can sell after you die. You get to respond with them with various Answers. Each answer increase a ""Social stat"" (Nice, Cool, Joke etc)

As your fame rises you can get various Sponsors that give bonuses depending on how you Answer to your fans. Ranging from Discounts, more damage, bonus XP and so forth.

In the ""Social Hub"" area you get a few Conversations between you and Teammates, Staff or can listen in between Teammates and Staff talking to each other (Sadly their are only a few of them)

A good thing is the option to use our mobile to purchase items on the spot (such as tools for lockpicking if we run out).

This prologue is a bit misleading in the sense that it gives you a lot of residential buildings but some are inaccessible as it is not the full game. You also see texts highlighted in red telling you what skills you'd need to use to - for instance - access the vents but some of these will probably be available only in the full game. It's a good ad, however, it begs the question how far you can go in the prologue. I'm already done with the story part (as the achievement popped) but I have some more missions to complete and skills to purchase.

But what can you steal in [i]Thief 2[/i]? Pretty much everything: kitchen appliances, vintage wine and bigger objects such as TVs or paintings that require the use of your car. Your vehicle, by the way, has a box that allows you to store 15 kgs of stuff in addition to the 15 kg you can put in your backpack. Once done you can head back to your hideout and check if anything special was requested by [i]BlackBay[/i]. If not, just got to the pawnshop and sell everything you have. As you make progress you'll learn to lockpick, hide and even to escape from the police. You can purchase intel to make a mission easier - it is recommended to spy first and find out when the owners of a propriety leave for the day. To make time pass fast you can sleep in your car but only in car parks.

Overall, I was satisfied with [i]Thief 2[/i], I have to admit, though, [i]American Theft[/i] had a better impression on me. Perhaps this is related to the '80s and to the fact that this prologue offers a very barebone story. No cutscenes just a contact telling us what to do; all the theft in order to ensure our debt is repaid to the mafia. Still, this is a neat little game that offers a couple of hours' playtime and it is completely free of charge.",1

0,138238254,2167340,"4/10 An app that demonstrates Unity physics engine in 3 scenes.

Note: press Tab to see controls. You can't really throw objects (only if you rotate while holding an object and release it while still rotating you will throw it a short distance like a mini-trebuchet).

Good:
- free
- scene 3 is actually fun for a while: you can jump down huge ramps. If you've been to an AquaPark that's a pretty similar feeling

So-so:
- no sfx at all
- music is a bit boring
- objects have simplistic looks and use a couple similar textures though the cubes have a nice white glow around the edges

Bad:
- well, essentially no gameplay. The game is just 3 scenes with cubes placed in them + some 3D models like tables and bookcases. You can pick them up, move to topple down stacks of cubes and right click to jump forward. All of this is simply the functionality of the engine, so I'm not sure what the author's role is apart from simply placing the 3D objects.

Btw why are all words capitalized in the description? Anyways, it's an app that can be fun for a couple minutes. But it's simply not enough to be a game. And without a button to throw objects it's not even much fun as a sanbdox. So it's rather a downvote.

My first issue was my frames, that went up to 100 which is not bad, I max it at 75 due to my monitor and my frames went wild, from 75 to 45 within seconds, even with no monsters around, game is not stabilized, I lowered my settings and issue persist.
When I keep them at 100+ they even dip down to 40 at random, me and my friend in a different area had the same issue.


Second and I think this is because I got told ""Well you play Dungeon Defenders so you'd like it"" na its more like Orcs must die, which I really do hate, but I do not wanna judge the game based off expectations on a different company with a different budget.

Third, the gameplay itself is subpar, not that good, I feel like im not making contact when I hit or swipe at all, I only get the feeling if I am using long ranged weapons. I also have a few nitpicks. .

First nick pick, do the mosnters not run in a standard line, I see them usually walking around traps at will, I assumed it'd be like a straight line ordeal and only get out of line if you try to fight them.

first of all, Welcome back Ubisoft, your greed brought you to epic but the lack of attention to the game made you come groveling back, good call on making it 75% off at ""launch"" or i would not have even touched this game to begin with. However, with your return you didnt bring achievements, the game is still buggy and it still runs through your launcher, so what was the point of going to epic in the first place if it acts as a launcher, FOR YOUR LAUNCHER?? 
Secondly, there is a major bug that has been known for over a year because i've found multiple people complaining about it where performance drops to a locked 10-20 frames after a cut scene or workbench menu. before that im running an easy 100fps on ultra settings on my 5800x and 3070TI, there is no way this is the first time you've heard about this ubisoft.

Good:
- gfx are pretty cute
- free
- I think I've never seen the topic of child care in a game, and it's refreshing to see it here

So-so:
- music is okay but repetitive since there are too few tracks and they are too short

Bad:
- gameplay is brain-dead, bugged and laggy. 
The first minigame asks you to click on flying symbols and drag them into correct buckets. This would be simple enough but this minigame lags like hell. I'm sure it's just awful programming there because there are just a dozen 2D sprites on the screen which any computer should be able to handle at max fps
The second and third minigame aren't really minigames because you can't affect the flying symbols on the screen and instead simply press one of 3 buttons to feed the child, wash it or read a book to it, to prevent the Sims-like bars from reaching zero. Each such action costs in-game money. But you don't see how much money you have or even how it's earned! You only find out that there is not enough money when you try to buy something and hear an error sound. Ridiculous
The third minigame asks you to drag some items on a wheel - again, this stage lags horribly and was stuck for me until I don't even know what I did and it resumed
I exited the game at that point, so maybe there is more variety there but I didn't have any hope left and gave up
- English localization is atrocious and it's hard to understand the instructions to these minigames, increasing confusion even more

0,138243273,1940340,"This game takes one step forward and two steps back. It has added so much more gameplay mechanics and customization and then has bad game mechanics to take back any enjoyment you have from it.


- The most egregious fault of this game is taking away player Agency by adding requirements to skills. for example: target has to have less than 25% health to use healing skill, ""oh you have 26% health? Too bad nerd, you don't get to use that.""
          Ex2:  less than 50% to be healed from this effect or else only the primary effect is used. which wouldn't be so bad on one healing skill, but ALL healing skills are like this.

- Everything gets a chance to not die (death's door) on reducing health to zero, enemies and you. The game is already hard enough why add this, or why not add this as a customization. ""all enemies now have Death Door chance for x2 reward bonus"" or something like that. Base game should not have that as an active mechanic.

- Stun no longer skips turns, it just delays to the end. There is very little use for this, why have it in the game at that point or just call it something else. Everyone who has played the first game knows stun to be something different, to change it into something lesser is not an improvement to the game.

- Bad Game mechanics that just frustrate and don't amount to enjoyable experience. boss giving themselves x3 (50%) dodge every turn they don't start with it while pouring status effects all over your team isn't enjoyable.


***  This game should be a resource management and strategy game where you are having a turn-based battle of attrition with an endless enemies. It should play like a game that despite all odds you can pull a win with great gamesmanship and experience, but what you get is a game you roll the of the dice and win despite the game's functionality.  ***

I think there is a good game in here somewhere but it's just too frustrating to play and woefully unbalanced.  Absolutely everything seems to be designed to irritate and punish the player to the point where I question why Red Hook think people play games, I, like most other people I assume, play a game to have fun and there is very little fun to be had here.

Whilst DD1 was probably a bit too weighted in the player's favour once you figured it out, DD2 has gone far too far in the other direction.  If a game has 100 tutorials in it's glossary, it might be that you've made it too complicated... but that aside, there are things that just seem overpowered, enemies constantly blocking and dodging is irritating enough, but when those enemies constantly heal the ones you can hit, combat can become very tedious.  Whilst your deathblow resistances seem to be a lie, I've lost count of the number of times a unit has died on the first deathblow hit despite having around a 70% chance of surviving.

If you enjoyed the first game you might like this, it's not all bad by any means, I love the Slay the Spire style maps, the sound design is spot on again (of course aided by Wayne June), the plot is promising and the way some units (in particular the Vestal for me) have had their skills re-designed is impressive.  But ultimately I'm always battling to have fun with the game, it shouldn't be this hard to find enjoyment in a game.",0
0,138242198,1940340,"One of the best turn based games that has an amazing dark vibe to it. Not as table-flip inducing as the first one. Great job listening to early access feedback!

Do I recommend other people torment themselves with this game. No. Hence the not recommended, if you know what this game is, you don't give a shit about these recommendations. If you don't know what you're getting into, this game is not exactly ""fun"" in the classic sense.",0
0,138241844,1940340,"This is a sequel like no other that I've played and i love it. 
What most sequels will do is either take 95% of the original game and barely change anything about it, making those who've invested their time and love with the original title feel like there is no point in returning to an 'outdated' version, while bringing nothing truly new to the table. Maybe new graphics and balance changes that could've just been added to the first. OR the sequel tries too hard to capture the magic of the original while completely ruining the feel that it gave to the original of the series.

Red hook has done a genius way of taking the brutal unforgiving combat that MADE the original, while still giving a new experience for old and new players of the series to enjoy. 

While the first game was focused on YOU the player, reclaiming a lost town from ruin and building it up from depravity in order to conquer anything in your path. The heroes are simply *tools* in order to complete your objective. Even with those you've spent time training to the highest level, you couldn't really get attached to them because the game made you KNOW you could lose them at any point. 

The second game however really puts the spotlight on the intriguing characters of the first. Diving deep into their back stories of what made them who they are, giving each character a unique personality and REASON to care for them. Instead building up the town so that recruits wouldn't be such a burden, you focus on making each character stronger with every run, finding new character paths and items that allow you to combine different strategies between the others without being heavily punished for simply experimenting.

It does a perfect job of sticking to its root in what made the first so enjoyable while still introducing new mechanics and game-play to not only draw in new players for a brutal yet re-playable experience, but also giving the veterans of D.D. a new feel of a lovable title. 

Its nice to have a sequel to a game that doesn't make you wanna stop playing the first. Their both very different from each other but thats good. 

If you want a Hard game play this one
If you want a BRUTAL game, play the first.
Either way, the bitter taste of victory or the disgusting stench of defeat will haunt you.  :)",1

0,138241053,1730250,"SUMMARY: A fun, easy-to-start, hard-to-master puzzle game where you build a landscape by aligning tiles, unlocking new buildings, and meeting challenges.  Pan'orama is a great fusion very much in the style of Dorfromantik and Islanders, that should probably be in your library if this is your jam.

Pan'orama is part of that slow-building buy enjoyable genre of ""envoronment-builder puzzles"" we've been blessed with over the years - Islanders, Dorfromantik, the Metro series, etc.  That genre could always use more entries, and Pan'orama is a worthy one.

You have a deck of environment tiles in random order - and you know the next few that are coming.  Align tiles right and you get points, and build an environment that generates more points.  Get enough points and you get buildings that will add new tiles, features, or increase scores.  As you play ""challenge"" tiles will appear that grant you more points for adding specific tile types.  How long can you keep going and what kind of wolrd will you build.

The core of the game is it's interaction - you can line up all sorts of combinations to keep going, and because you're ""thinking"" on a 2D board and about the influences of certain buildings, it adds noteable challenge.  It's never completely overwhelming, but you'll need to think now and then.  Nothing is unclear, more the interactive elements start to come together.

All of this is done in a charming presentation of chill music and nice graphics.  Be sure to zoom in on your landscape to catch all sorts of cute details!

So is the game good?  Yes, it's very good.  If you at all enjoyed any of its predecessors you'll love it.  Plus the game can go longer when you get into the zone, so it avoids some of the frustration of short, sudden failures.

If there's a flaw it's that Pan'orama feels less innovative and more a ""polishing"" of previous formulas, especially Dorfromantik.  You won't see anything new here, just what came before done very, very well.  That's no reason not to buy the game, of course.

So if you liked what you've seen in this genre, grab Pan'orama.  It's worth it.",1

0,138243246,2369390,"Eh. I'd recommend this game at the $15 dollars I paid, but I'm doing thumbs down because it is NOT worth the full asking of $60. It's like any other farcry game, except it's slightly worse than farcry 5. Animations are wonky, gunplay is SO much worse than nearly every other FPS game out there (mw2, apex, Bf2042, counter strike, etc), too much running around with no purpose, etc. 

This game is really a time sink. Rewarding one? Meh.

It's also not very.... believable? 75% of soldiers are women (or trans women), 95% of leaders are women (or trans women), a real rebellion would not have a ratio like that, men would be doing most of the fighting. This is not sexist, this is simply stating that the environment of the game is very fictional and keeps me from getting immersed. Previous Farcry titles are fairly immersible, and this one sticks out as not.

Crafting in games is generally good. However, this game just has it as a grind and the crafting is very simplistic. Your weapons get at most, 3 attachments, and it's usually ""ammo"" , ""sight"" , ""muzzle."" - of which you have 2 or 3 choices between them and that's it. Man, it's 2023. Not 2011. The freaking crossbow on MW2 has more options for customization than every gun on this game combined. That's on top that the gun-feel sucks. Just... ubisoft is NOT good at making FPS games apart from Rainbow 6, and I hope they stop making FPS games. Stick to stuff you're good at like more games like AC Odyssey. This isn't it.

Time just flies by when riding in this game.",1
0,138242330,2349830,"This game is too barebones to recommend in its current state, and what's there needs a lot of work.

The inventory system is an interesting idea, but unfortunately as implemented the game quickly turns into a mess of random effects with no clear feedback on each weapon's effectiveness.  Each character starts with a weapon that's available from the random item pool, but since that weapon is not on the grid it is not eligible for the spell card combinations.  There's no other distinction between the characters, and since weapon balance is also poorly tuned, some characters like Remilia are immediately at a significant disadvantage to fight off the swarm of fairies at the start.  This is exacerbated by XP / money pickups despawning shortly after dropping, meaning you have little time to pick them up after kiting enemies away.

Focus movement is questionable in its current form, even if it is obviously a nod to Touhou.  You don't control when your weapons activate; they fire on their own individual timers, and many weapons fire in the direction you are facing.  While Focus lets you hold aim, it slows you down significantly.  Enemies quickly start moving faster than you do regardless of Focus, so you will rarely have time to use this before your more useful weapons fire; spell cards such as Master Spark often get aimed in a random direction because you're too busy running away when it happens to activate.  Other games in this genre (like 20MTD, Touhou Library Survivors, etc) let you control when to fire your weapons which works much better with this kind of mechanic.

The UX also needs work; cannot return to main menu from the character select screen, item tooltips only visible by holding down Q while hovering over the item (why not just show the tooltip on hover?), item descriptions are vague, and I initially did not realize that using a weapon horizontally or vertically meant rotating the weapon while dragging it in the inventory grid.  Weapons are shown in game as a bunch of small icons in the corner with cooldown timers that are difficult to read at a glance.

Beyond all of that... there's just not much here to keep the player engaged.  The only stage is an open field with barely anything on it, the enemies are all generic or forgettable Touhou fare, etc.  If there are any boss enemies I did not encounter them.  There are achievements in game but they are not linked to Steam for some reason.  Money is only used to unlock characters, but as mentioned previously this makes no difference outside of the opening minutes.  Simply put you have no reason to play this more than once.

My experience comes mostly from the campaign. The last mission was terrible. It's supposed to be 4v4+the player (4v5) but in my case it was 3v3 for the most time. The orc starts with lots of vassals that spam flying AOE mages and sends groups of 3 stacks one after another, so it's really hard to take any vassal out and defend your new cities. I've defeated him by some miracle when I yolo-ed across 1/3 of the map with 3 of my  stack while being chased by 5-6 full stacks. 2 of my AI friends were trying to defend against 1 enemy kitty, and the kitty was winning before I came to help after dealing with the orc. 1 AI from each side were AFK the whole game, my last ally was able to take out his opponent (almost lost at some point), and then went AFK for the rest of the game defending 4 of his cities with 5-6 full stacks each when NO ONE attacked him. I've played that on easy and it took me about a whole day worth of hours. Not a single other mission in this game or missions played on normal in AoW3 or Planetfall was such a drag.

0,138245011,1940340,"It's more Darkest and less Dungeon.

It feels like an overhaul of DD1 rather than a sequel. They put more emphasis on the Roguelite aspects where they tighten the restrictions on skills (looks at healing skills) to put more pressure on the players on an already RNG-heavy game. 

Would I trade trade travel healing for the old spamming my heals mechanic? gods yes!!

Now, taking my DD1 glasses off. It's actually a very decent game. The permanent buffs would give you the impression that you can eventually snowball the stages.. but RNGesus says no [insert the stands in your way and stops you meme' here].

The Good:
-Graphics. The mix between 2D and 3D is done beautifully.
-Biomes? Environments? the supposed Dungeons in Darkest DUNGEON?. They've strayed away from dark dank caves to fully ""open"" environments where they all looked unique and not just a cave with corals or a cave with tree roots or a cave with ruins.
-Relationships. It's either we help together because we're about to die anyway, or kill each other because we're about to die anyway.
-Enemy variety.. (debatable)
-Flapjacks. Everybody like flapjacks!!

The Bad:
-Lair Bosses. These feels like they are supposed to be the ""final destination"" for the stages but they are too overtuned and the devs were like.. ""hmm.. these are too OP, the players would not be able to proceed to the next stages and wipe immediately so let's make them ""optional"" ..until chapter 2 hehehe""
-Locking new Biomes/Environments on new chapters. I'm only on Chapter 2 (Lung Boss.. yep) and I'm already sick of the Sprawl and the Tangle.
-Skill Cooldowns. Some have them, most don't.. why exactly?
-Limited Use Skills. Again, why? ""..to add difficulty duh"" yeah, artificial. I'm already fighting RNG, give me a break!!
-Skills with cooldowns AND limited uses. BRUH!!
-The Mountain.. at least make it THE DUNGEON even if it's like a single prison cell at the end.

All in all, this feels like the direction they want to make in terms of gameplay for sequels(the real ones) and I don't really mind it. I like that they took this risk early. DD1 was good but if DD2 was the same then why not just make an expansion.",1

Darkest Dungeon 2 does work for me. It retains 70% of the identity of the first, but changes the gameplay loop into the roguelike format that, while common, is executed very well. It is a different game, a different experience, and a good sequel.

Some are saying it is not a true sequel to the first one, but I think it is. Instead of making a game in the same style as the first, they have made it a continuation of their mechanics they built in the first and making you have to experience it in a different format requiring different approaches. They took a risk by not repeating exactly what they did for the first and naturally some fans will be disappointed.

Ultimately, the game feels great, looks stellar, and is a good experience. Fans of the first should still enjoy this and those who didn't care for the first may find that they love this new approach.",1

The best early game gear is literally the level 1 gear that shoots behind you, if you level it up you cant kite enemies and they instantly kill you. Game design is literal trash. Sound design is trash. The stage system is trash. Pretty much one of worst games I've ever played.

But... why am i recommending this garbage dump?

Simple. The developers Valorware also make the insanely good 11/10 rpg 9th Dawn. I bought this game so the developers could have some money to develop the next 9th Dawn game. That's why I recommend buying this piece of trash. Just think of it as a one time patreon donation for the devs to make another 9th Dawn. 

These developers are one of the only ones that make real mobile rpg games through the 9th Dawn series. They deserve this $5 and much more for that. So yes I will happily throw money at their face. 

Also, if you're reading this, do yourself a favour and go get the latest 9th Dawn. You can even get it on your phone. If you like it, you can come back here and throw some money at the devs so hopefully they get some motivation to make the good stuff.

If any devs are reading this, please make more 9th Dawn games. But give it a different name instead of 9th Dawn 4, call it something like, 'Chronicles of the Abyssal' 'Heavens Tales' 'Chronicles of Tarnished' -or something Final Fantasy / Nintendo JRPG style.

The graphics are pretty good, I get the feeling there might be some balancing issues, but.. I don't know what they may or may not be since everything seems powerful in its own right.

The customization of your faction is absolutely amazing, I love it, 10/10. My only issue is I wish there was more customization and some of the traits seem more powerful than others in terms of gameplay. One common trait I seen taken up is Overwhelming Tactics, since a 20% buff to crit chance is pretty nutty, ngl. I get the feeling the game is going to get more fleshed out over time in terms of customization, kind of like how Stellaris was fleshed out more and more by DLCs. 

The combat is pretty tight and the music.. awww man the music. It really does a great job of setting the tone. I really want to hear more of this composer's work. The battles where you are uncertain of the outcome and fields of trampled grass plays.. mmmm so good.

I hope the devs listen to criticism and take some things to heart.

My recommendation is buy the game, try it out for about 2 hours and decide if you like it or not. If you don't you can always get a refund via Steam's refund policy. I've been hooked onto it, and I hope to see this game grow and change into something greater over time. 

---------

Now I'd like to address some of the complaints and negative reviews I've seen. Mainly from the old timer AOW players. I want to go over just a couple complaints and then respond to them.

Things they don't like:

1. Racial Identity is non-existent. The common claim is that races are just amorphous blobs, stripped of any identity, but I think that is kind of the point. You are given the creative freedom to mold and shape your own unique race based on racial attributes, culture, societal traits, tomes, and more! You want Angelic barbaric warrior halfings, go nuts! You want to engage in some Nature oriented Heavy Industry Elves, have at it! You want some Frozen Orc Paladin holy orders running around, heck yeah! The race itself has the identity you choose to give it, rather than it being pre-defined. With the customizations in place you can have oh so much variety and options in your playstyle. It opens more doors than it closes. More playstyle variety. Take for example Orcs in AOW3. They got +5 health +1 Melee ATK -1 Ranged ATK (Going from an example I saw in a post, this could be inaccurate) This naturally gears those orcs to a specific playstyle of melee oriented. This is very restrictive, if you want to play ranged you can, but its already putting you behind the other factions. In AOW4, you can easily swap traits for the build you want. In AOW4 you could give your orcs Keen-sighted and give them a 30% accuracy on ranged attacks, so you could live out your wild orc hunters fantasy, or expert longbow orcs, whatever really.  I think its a rather boring world where every orc is exactly the same, every halfling is exactly the same, every human, every elf, etc. etc. More customization is never a bad thing in my opinion. Variety is the spice of life, as they say.

2. Micromanagement removal. From what I've read, a lot of old AOW players are mad that a bunch of micromanagement elements were taken out, like Settlers for example. Honestly, they can ditch that stuff if you ask me. Getting rid of micromanagement makes the game more accessible to new players. Reason being, it doesn't have as steep of a learning curve to 'git gud' at it. I love RTS and TBS games, but they do have learning curves to them, steeper than ones in say.. an FPS game. The more micromanagement you add to it, the steeper the learning curve becomes and the less appealing it is to new players to get into. I, personally, don't like to micromanage every little detail, I don't need to personally touch every single grain of rice my farmers farm. (Exaggeration, but you get my point lol.) There's a reason the term micromanagement is typically associated in a bad light, its tedious and most of the time, not enjoyable, but.. apparently not the case with AOW oldheads.

3. No unique racial units. This has been addressed by many before. Culture wasn't a thing back in previous iterations of AOW. Racial units have been moved over to Culture, so you still have the racial units just under a different name and thus giving you even more diversity of your chosen units. A Ratfolk Berserker, Human Berserker, and dwarf Berserker might all be different based on their Mind/Body traits. Hell the Ratfolk berserker might be more skirmishy, weaving in and out of the fight to hit weakened targets. The Human berserker might rank up faster and still do massive damage even when half the units are whacked. The dwarf berserker might be extraordinarily tough and fight in formation with other dwarven berserkers leading to a +3 bonus in their total defenses making them extraordinarily tanky frontliners. The racial traits can be swapped at faction creation too so you can have all manner of unique and interesting combinations and playstyles!

Like it or not, change is happening. It seems the devs want to simplify things somewhat so new players can get engaged with the series and with this engagement.. you get more players who will potentially look at the previous titles and give them a shot and then make their own judgement calls.

With a lot of the hate and vitriol some old timers are spewing in the discussions and reviews section, I think I'd rather stay away from AOW3 and its predecessors given how toxic these people are coming across. I get it, I really do. This feeling of spite and anger, that's what I feel towards World of Warcraft and Overwatch. Games that had better times in their past and changed for worse in present day. That doesn't mean change isn't good, it just isn't what we want. Overwatch and WoW made changes that made it easier for newer players to get into, which is basically what AOW4 is doing. It's going to alienate the oldtimers but bring in some fresh blood. Face it, you just don't like change, even if its beneficial because you're set in the old ways. I get it, I really do.

At the time of this review its sitting at an 83% positive (Which is 2% greater than AOW3 :P) They must be doing something right, but only time will tell if this changes. For now, I stand by this review. It's a good game in my opinion.",1

0,138247783,1651490,"Got this as a Birthday Present from my younger sister, who thankfully knows I love life sim games.

The game gives me strong The Sims 1 vibes, but in a slightly more pixelated sense. It's straight forward to play, nostalgic and the music is quite nice to listen to. However, although I say I recommend the game there are quite a few things that need work on:

- Constant music is nice, but it would be nice to either have an in-game radio or allow for custom music to be added as it does get repetitive.

- When Tinies go for a visit, can they please just wait outside to be allowed in? Currently they turn up and then help themselves to everything in the house (which isn't great if you have money issues and are surviving on leftovers) AND wake Tinies up as well.

- Why is it so difficult to get money? Jobs are good and all, but the bills that arrive on Friday... it's a lot no matter how small the house is. This needs a little looking into cause it seems that every time money comes in, it's gone again [i](Real life simulator ftw?)[/i]

- Leading on from this, do [b]not[/b] make a new family to add into the game if it is a Friday - you'll get sent some bills, and if you don't have the money available you will end up with the first week with no electric or water in the house.

- The needs need a little bit of reworking. The needs seem to be very specific at times (i.e. only comedy on TV brings up the fun quickly whilst other channels do it very slowly), and drain very quickly and are hard to fill back up.

- Currently there appears no way to be ""married"". You can set yourselves as dating, but when trying to make a family there is no marriage option. You can however imply it by having a child and selecting the other tinies as the parents.

As this is in early access, I understand that things are still getting worked on - and I really do enjoy life simulator games - and because I do see a lot of potential in this game, I've set this as ""recommended"" for now.

The swap to a roguelike model is okay, but doesn't really play as well because they've somehow managed to make the game even grindier. Balance feels a bit off as well; enemies constantly get dodge, block and crit buffs which turns every fight into a slog. It's not so much that it's too hard, it's just not very fun. Death's Door acts pretty weird too, even after the latest patch that nerfs it a bit for monsters. I had a boss stay on DD for 4-5 turns even with me successfully hitting them every turn. Meanwhile the boss was getting double turns and almost wiped my otherwise winning/healthy team. It was doable, just again, not fun.

My suggestion is wait for a sale and for more balance passes, as well as modding (if we even get that.) I agree with some of the other reviews that it's not necessarily a bad game in and of itself, it just doesn't really feel like Darkest Dungeon and they should have branched off into a new IP.",0

I originally played the game after I watched both Blitz and Real Civil Engineer lose the game. After a long while of watching these 2 youtubers play different kinds of games, I decided to finally try one of the games they play and recommend. Its also right up my alley, city builder, strategy, urban planning, but lo and behold, I learned my lesson the hard way. Good thing its only 6 dollars and so its not really much, but boyy im never buying anything recommend by sponsored youtubers ever again.

I watched Blitz play and thought huh, it seems so easy how can it even be considered a strategy game and most importantly, how did Blitz end up losing? To be fair, Blitz isnt the best strategy game youtuber out there, but he also isnt really dumb. I wondered quite a bit, then I saw real civil engineer play the game and he did some real good optimization, and yet both of them lost at the 1 hour mark. 

So I thought, the game is probably not as easy as it seems, perhaps theres some hidden machinations that make it more exciting than it looks. Perhaps the difficulty increases, or perhaps there is more content, after all, what kind of sponsored youtuber shows you the entire game right out the bat. 

So I bought it, played it up to the one hour mark, up to the two hour mark, and finally I finished at 2 hours 30 mins. Yes I finished the entire game in 2 hours and 30 minutes. 

I realized at the one hour mark just why both youtubers lost at this point. It wasn't that the game got progressively harder, or that it required actualy strategy, they literally just lost it. They lost their shit, not the game, their shit! The game is so boring, even if you were buddha you'd lose your patience at the 1 hour mark. It was a grueling grind, literally you do the same thing for hours, and oh lord it is tedious. The game looks zen, but dont let it fool you. Theres nothing zen about having to zoom in and out, trying to differentiate from similar looking tiles, trying to look for the missions that are already so small since the map has gotten so big. It literally felt like a visual acuity test. 

And by the way, have I even mentioned the unoptimized game settings? I know my laptop isn't the best laptop for gaming in the world, but I could play minecraft and Dota 2 with no problems in this intel i5, with an nvidia geforce graphics card. But this game? It lags, it freezes, it bugs out, and the scrolling becomes progressively slower as you play and add more entities into the game.   

There is no strategy, no difficulty, and no zen in this game, just hours of mindless clicking. 

Good lord, I could say I enjoyed the first 30 mins, but after that, its just a painful grind. 

Yeah, absolutely, do not buy this game.

0,138248776,1159690,I like this game. I got bored though. Definitely buy it and get in on the ground floor. There is a lot of room for improvement and I think they will do that.,1
0,138248023,1159690,"I like the concept of Voidtrain, but as of the date of this review (May 5, 2023) I cannot recommend it.

I've played the game for a little over 5 hours and from what I've seen the game offers little variety and becomes boring quite quickly.

I'll do my best to give you an idea of the gameplay I've experienced so far:

You spend most of your time riding a train on a straight track through the ""Void"" while collecting resources floating in space near the track.  There is zero gravity in the environment except on and above the train platform (and within  the Train Stations you encounter along the way).  You are tethered to the train and can only venture out so far.  While riding the train, you may also encounter various Void creatures.  Some of them are harmless and provide a source of food.  Others will attack you or the train.  You can fight back using weapons you acquire during your travels.  You can also build various crafting stations on the train that allow you to craft items and resources, research new technology, and fortify the train.

Every so often, the train stops at a station where you can find resources, fight enemies, upgrade your train, and find clues about the world and story.

Gameplay so far has been driven by on-screen prompts to research and build the next level of technology and narrated events.  It's all very linear with little opportunity to make any decisions about how to progress.

The Train Stations have offered little variety so far.  I've encountered a handful so far and the layouts are mostly the same with a few minor variations.  There is a definite feeling of deja vu at each stop.

I know the game offers more than I've seen so far, but it's not interesting enough for me to want to continue - at least for now.

Overall the game just feels very basic and lacks excitement.  There needs to be a better sense of freedom and exploration.  I'm not sure how the developers could add that since the game is literally and figuratively ""on rails"".

My advice to the developers would be to add more variety to the outposts and add more things to do while travelling on the train.  Perhaps there is already more to it than I've seen, but  if there is it needs to be introduced earlier to maintain the player's interest.  I'd also shift the focus from simply telling players what to do next to letting them discover it on their own.  I read that there were plans to optionally disable the narrator and I think I'd also like to see the option to disable the ""quests"" that prompt you to build the next level of tech.  I'd like to feel like I have some level of control on how to progress rather than feeling like the game is just a series of checking off boxes.

I think the game is priced far too high.  I've gotten far more enjoyment and play time out of less expensive games like Valheim or 7 Days to Die.

Lastly, I've seen some criticism of other negative reviews.  A lot of people seem to believe that you shouldn't criticize an ""Early Access"" game.  However my review speaks to my feelings about the current state of the game and whether I'd recommend it right now.  I do plan on revisiting it again if there are more content updates but for now I'm moving on to other games.  I think it's a good concept but it needs to be fleshed out a bit more before it's worthy of my time.",0

0,138247201,2369390,"The first thing me, my cooperative-mode friend, & a viewer of my stream said at the same exact time was ""Man, these graphics suck!"".

The antagonist does not stir any emotions, the gameplay & character movement is way too fast paced, many parts of the story are flawed; such as the protagonist escaping a boat being riddled with holes; Castillo being allowed to get away with the crimes he does even with civilians & his son idling by, the difficulty of the game isn't there; with tanks being found five minutes after having left said riddled boat, & workbenches being absolutely everywhere & plentiful for weapon customizations, overall the game feels like a rinse & repeat; the trailers are not comparable to the game; as usual, they copied the same story from their previous titles; basically the same villain-&-influential-bystander-as-protagonist, same game mechanics made worse, same downgraded graphics rinse & repeat from their other titles, & so on. And Lita, oh how they mention this character so much when I was around them for not even a minute.

If you are someone who just wants a game to enjoy & pass the time, & does not care about an immersive story or solid, paced gameplay, then this is for you. 
If you are someone who came for a story to embrace, a game that felt long & filled with content, & genuinely memorable characters, then this is not at all the game for you.

For a big game with tons of storage space taken up, it has felt nothing shorter of a basic game with forgettable everything.

Now the not so good to terrible. Desync all the things anytime you play multiplayer, typically once per battle, never on campaign map except over end turns. This game is horribly optimized, it doesn't feature a standard resolution option like every other, so if you have a 4k monitor the game just runs in 4k, and so on. There are work arounds but they have to be reapplied every single time you play. Enemies will field far more stacks then you easily, despite smaller cities and resource pools. Their heroes rank up much faster even while abstaining from combat, (some level 11 when yours are 3-4 despite fighting every turn). Be prepared for some very unfavorable engagements even on normal difficulty.

Now the worst, really hoping this gets remedied asap. EVERY SINGLE TIME the game or ANY mod you are using gets updated, ALL of your multiplayer sessions will fail to load indefinitely. You cannot force the game to load and update the mods like it would in other titles, you cannot revert the mods back to previous versions of themselves to resume, you cannot force steam to simply never update worship content unless you are unplugged and cannot do multiplayer without a LAN cable. So basically you can play vanilla, or you can play single player with mods, but you can't do multiplayer with mods at least during this time.

Absolutely adored AOW3, multiplayer didn't suffer from any of these issues, hoping #4 can get there. This game has utter loads of potential, but if you were like me and paid for the premium and all potential DLC, had a bunch of mates do the same only to find out they can't play together the way they want, well upsetting is an understatement.",0
0,138250975,1669000,"I'm only 6 hours into the game, so this is only my first impression.

I played AOW3 and Planetfall and from what I have seen yet, AOW4 took the best of those games and added more good stuff. The customizability definetly increased.

I disagree with some of the negative reviews that complain about not having magical alignment anymore. I think by combining several magical tomes, the factions you can create become even more diverse, not less. Also if you want, you can specialise still.

So far I didn't have a single crash and I didn't see any bugs in singleplayer (only some poor translation to German). Multiplayer seems to have some problems at the moment, but I'm sure they will sort that out soon.

I researched on linkedin who the designers are, because I wanted to make sure whether they started their careers at a circus. Imagine having a turn based game, but locking the players out of continuing doing their turn when others fight their battle... even though that outcome makes no difference to the other players (unless they plan to attack your army straight after - something that could be solved easily. Naturally this makes the tbs tactical combat part of the game unplayable and the game, for me, pointless, since there's civ, TW and other such games where I can play mappainter simulation. The worst part really is that it is absolutely unnecessary. This is even true for player decisions, but I gove them the benefit of the doubt that there are decisions causing huge map changes for everyone (not!). Imagine spending 10 minutes in your tactical and then when you click end turn after you still have to wait because your opponents weren't able to do their stuff in the meanwhile. Mindboggling!
The devs clearly NEVER played theor own game even once - maybe just the small parts of the game they personally had to design, but never the entire thing.

We are in good hands and should await the growth of DD2 instead of mindlessly hating the game loop. It's still within the Darkest Dungeon world (lore).

Before the first launch took place the lead dev made claims that they use cheap servers so adding more would be easy and they could hold like 5k per server. The first launch was so bad the game had to be ""re-launched"". 

Some things were added etc in the 2 weeks they had to plan for a re-launch, but nothing was done to fix the complete lack of knowledge this team has about how network infrastructure and server technology work. The publisher has not bothered at all to try to help and the team is completely silent.

0,138254200,1669000,"This is a great game but it needs more time in the oven. Even in its current form it's very addictive, but anyone buying it should understand that it still has a pretty hefty number of bugs. It has some visual glitches but I honestly don't care much about that, far more serious are the many gameplay and ability bugs currently in the game, ranging from small nuisances to serious bugs. It's quite playable ( and very fun! ) but just buggy at the moment.

Definitely *strongly* recommend but you may possibly want to wait for more patches. Both Triumph and Paradox generally have good long-term support for their games so I am confident this will get where it needs to be.",1

This game might be solo fun for one playthrough, but there is no real campaign. For a Pvp game its to slow, i'd recommend Endless Legend for that. It's just not worth the price tag imo.",0
0,138252774,1669000,"Absolutely loving this game so far.  Best 4X game on the market if you ask me.  [i]However...[/i]

This game is absolutely cooking my CPU, and since the latest update, hard crashing my entire rig after a random amount of time.  5900X / 6800XT with 32GBs of DDR5 and I'm averaging around 71FPS with 100% CPU usage the entire time.  (For comparison, Cyberpunk at max settings (no raytracing) runs at a steady 140-150FPS at 1440p.)  The only other program I have that gets my CPU that hot is Cinebench.  I don't have my AC on yet so it's a little warmer inside than I'd like, but hitting 100% CPU load and 70-75C on a 360mm AIO playing a 4X game?  All other games I play barely breach 60C right now.  

GPU usage is also very low with mid 50C temps, barely any fanspeed, and yet my CPU is going through hell and back to keep this thing running.  Changing graphics settings from max to low is negligible for performance gains as well.  There's definitely some major issues under the game's hood right now, which is a real shame because it's such a damn good game.

So unfortunately, until the devs address the horrible performance and stability issues, I simply can't recommend the game in its current state.",0

Things I'd like to see:
- More options for controlling the radius of the barrier, a 123 hotkey version that flicks instant between max, medium and a very small but still active barrier would be great for more accurate play 
- Having no effect on the eggs except popping them is kinda disappointing, I'd love to see some upgrades that make the eggs you pop grow back slower eg. freeze/cryo
- Explosion radius from mortars imho should pop eggs within radius but instakill anything hatching

0,138255165,1159690,"A Raft style survival where you basically bring your base along with you. I will be making a lot of comparisons to Raft as that really is the gold standard currently for this style of survival.

Resource gathering is a chore and every single item you only get one of. You have to ""swim"" to each item to collect it for a very long time until you get the hookshot which only really extends like, 10 feet. Compared to Raft where you start with the hook, resources might come within reach of the boat, and there's ""bonus"" barrels containing lots of resources. Voidtrain has ""stops"" along the way with some crates that might drop like 1-3 items, but not a lot. Speaking of which, enemies are at these stops and if you die you lose all inventory items. Why? Where the fuck did it go? I guess the void in voidtrain is a big more accurate for items. Should call this void items.

The items are very annoying to handle, fuel is a constant need and when you only get one log every so often you are just sitting around waiting. There's a lot of crap to carry around too and not a lot of storage. The only chest you get for a while has only four slots. FOUR! Even raft gave you eight for the basic cooler, and then it wasn't long after that you got the bigger chest.

The UI and crafting is terrible, everything you use has a 1 second animation where the UI is brought up and you have to wait. One second you might ask? Who would complain about such a thing? Try out Raft and then want to craft something that requires multiple parts. You'll need to access your storage crates, access your crafting menu, and refuel the furnaces for what you need. It's all seemless, no animations to load it up all fancy, usually requires a simple press of the e to access or refuel. Void Train makes it all more complicated. E to access storage, wait, grab items, exit window. E to access station, wait, choose a fuel, choose an item category, choose a item to craft, click craft, exit out of four windows.

If you were on the fence with the first one... I actually don't know if the new gameplay is interesting enough to really grab you. But things move a lot faster, some enemies have new gimmicks, dialogue choices matter a bit more, and maybe most importantly, the central gimmick of the series is fixed - the new Soul Cannon will force itself to fire if you don't move fast, which also incentivizes using the Managarm.

Also since they don't have to introduce a bunch of kids this time around way more of the plot is focused on doing plot things with character arcs and so on.",1

[h1]Not perfect but the best you can get[/h1]
The Isle of Man Tourist Trophy is about the craziest race there is. The game does a great job giving you that experience as player.

Performance is sadly not as perfect as I wish. The engine is outdated, doesn't support DLSS or FSR and despite delivering 90-130 FPS there's always a slight stutter at some point. Not game-breaking bad, but still noticable.

Still they make the best they can with it. The landscape is very varied and the studio did a great job making it not feel like a complete copy & paste job. 

There are plenty of options to lower difficulty to a beginner friendly level. If you're unfamiliar with bike racing a few tips:
[list]
[*]Use beginner physics, they are far more forgiving than realistic ones
[*]Start a career in Supersport, the bikes have less power and topspeed and are slightly more nimble
[*]Play in exterior view. While 1st person is awesome and thrilling, it's the worst to learn the course and bike behavior
[*]Lean into curves early, not when you just reach it
[*]At beginner level you can break later than indicated, maybe 0.5-0.75s when entering the ""red zone""
[*]Change controller sensitivity: custom control layout, sensitivity 5 (default -5) and deadzone 1 (default 10)
[*]Play it safe till you know the course, not crashing saves you far more time, than taking a curve on the very edge of performance
[*]If you leave track (curbsides, gravel, sand, grass), don't break and don't accelerate. Carefully try to get back to track, that's your best bet not to crash.
[/list]

[h1]Positives:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Varied landscape and courses
[*]great physics
[*]incredible speed sensation (especially in 1st person view)
[*]great variation of drivers and bikes
[*]great difficulty options
[*]high long time value 
[*]Time restricted challenges apart from online championship: measure your skill with others outside of a race by beating their times
[/list]

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[*]No DLSS/FSR support, no stable FPS. Not as smooth as I expect of a racing game (e.g. Forza Horizons or Grid). Even at low settings I get occasional micro stutter
[*]Upgrade system is kinda stupid: you upgrade parts, and your opponents do so along. In the end, it just increases general performance and difficulty for you ;)
[*]Carreer qualify/race system is stupid: you do a qualify time one part of a track, only to do a race one a different one afterwards. Where's the point in that?

[h1]Final thoughts[/h1]
Ride, Rims, TT Isle of Man... Why the few superbike games on the market can't deliver a smooth racing experience? The last  one I personally recall is the ancient Superbike World Championship by EA (1999). TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3 still is a great gaming experience and racing those high power machines through towns and country roads is awesome fun. The learning curve for beginners might be high, but there's enough of options to give you a fighting chance.",1
0,138253148,1924170,"TT3 Takes the great simulation from Rims Racing and combines it with an immersive open world set on the Isle of Man itself. Having the open world on the Isle of Man is absolutely awesome, and is much preferred to previous games open world on made up roads in Ireland. I want to point out that contrary to what T_balls implies in his review, the open world feature is not a time waster. Races and challenges are in different locations on the map, but you are not required to ride to the location to start a race. You can simply open the map and start the race from there. The simulation is much improved from the last game to be more realistic and challenging, well also being more predictable. In the previous game you might fly off your bike instantly while going straight over a small bump. TT2 also gave your tires infinite grip and would not allow you to lean too far. Though that might make the game easier if you want a more realistic simulation of a motorcycle than TT3 is the right game for you. However if you want to just chill out and go fast around a beautiful course, then you can simply turn down the simulation and it becomes much more difficult to lose control of the bike. 

A few people have been whining about not being able to flip the bike side to side in a split second. Besides the fact that they are exaggerating how much slower the transition is compared to other games, there are settings that you can change to make it more sensitive. You can also improve the way you enter a corner by trail braking more, as a bike will turn in better when the front is loaded. If you going though a fast corner that doesn't require braking you can let off slightly as you initial the lean. 

The upgrading process is much more convenient and easy to use than the previous game. All you need to do is get upgrade points from racing, then spend them on upgrades. There is no requirement to complete other things to unlock access to high level upgrades before you can buy them.  

There are a couple bugs I have found as per our usual arrangement with new games I guess. One bug involves not being able to shift gears when you start a race or challenge. This seems to only happen occasionally, and when it does you can fix it by exiting the race, shifting gear in the open world (you are always in the open world if not in a race or challenge), then restart the race. You do not need to restart the game. I have also experienced an audio bug where after riding around for about 30 minutes sometimes the engine sound at low RPM will be distorted and shifting sounds slower. However no one else seems to have had that issue. 

Overall I recommend this game to any racing fan, and especially any motorcycle racing fan. The game is quite immersive and can also be a great teacher of all things TT related.",1

This review will focus on the game itself and ignore all the bugs still present after the relaunch. Spoiler the game itself is bad. 
This game proclaims itself as an ""old school MMO"", which means they intentionally make bad game design decisions and won't apologize for it. 
Because it advertises like this the community is filled with people making fun of you for asking for help because you can't figure it out on your own. 
THERE IS LITERALLY NO FRIENDSLIST!! WHAT'S THE POINT OF AN MMO WITH NO FRIENDSLIST? 
LITERALLY NO WAY TO FIND SOMEONE AGAIN BECAUSE WHISPERING REQUIRES YOU TO RIGHT CLICK
THEIR IN GAME MODEL. It may as well be singleplayer because there's no way to make connections with people.
The game does a terrible job explaining things, mostly via text dumps. 
The woodcutter explains how to cut wood, but won't explain what to do with it after.
You can't even access the herbology tutor because they are behind locked doors and the guards don't explain how you can meet them, the guards only say location which is useless if the door is locked. 
Tutorial shows you how to gather, how to cook, how to repair. It does not explain combat. 
Tutorial does not cover crafting at all. 
You need to type to npc's and find the correct words to prompt them for information.  It's like they wanted to be cool and have AI NPC's, except none of the NPC's are AI and it's just a visual novel with preprogrammed inputs that you don't know. You can't even do prompts which make sense in context of the quest. If I return to the baker and say ""I have brought the rabbit and mushrooms"" the npc literally does nothing. There is no point in this convoluted system of talking to npc's that they made. 
If you hover over hemp it says it needs to be processed at the fiber station. When you
go to the fiber station you can deposit them hemp into it yet nothing happens
because you haven't talked to the herbologist located behind a locked door. 
No diagonal movement - this is intentional and will not be added.
AOE spells and getting attacked does not cause you to start autoattacking. 
Only auto targeted spells start auto attacking.
Parts of terrain are not visible unless you rotate the camera, this starts affecting
gameplay even during the tutorial. They also never explain you can rotate the camera. 
Many NPC's will not repeat quest dialog, so if you didn't memorize everything the first time
around then you can not prompt it for locational clues. 
For gathering resources that need tools, you need to right click, click a context option and then click to select the tool you want to use to harvest the resource. This is way too slow and clunky. Harvesting should just be a one click, not 3 clicks. 
There is no timer on combat, so you don't know when you are about to leave combat so that you can rest. 
You just need to wait for the icon to disappear, which again they don't even explain that there are status icons. 
If you hover or select a spell it does not have any range indicators. 
If you are standing next to some terrains some spells just can't be cast. Not a bug. 
Minimap does not show ladders. So you can be stuck in a cave and not know where to go, oldschool MMO garbage design.
Minimap is pixelated but not 1:1, so it shows gaps in walls that aren't actually there.
Minimap does not show points of interest, like banks or vendors. 
Mobs do not have a leash range. Mobs can attack while moving but you cannot attack while moving. 
You can see items on the ground that other players drop, but you literally cannot interact with it. 
There are no keybinds for quick storage, which literally every game has. You have to manually drag
and drop items into storage. 
If multiple things are visually stacked on top of each other you can only select the entity in front. 
I found lots of seeds while gathering, don't know where I can plant them.
Multiple quests are unfinishable if you don't ask for help because of the old school ""figure it out"" mentality of the developers. But if you literally walk tile by tile through the main town the junk quest cannot be completed because the 4th one doesn't exist. 

Keep in mind these issues are not bugs, they are intentional. The interface is garbage, the playability is garbage, you can't make friends, and nothing is explained to you. Even when they eventually fix all the gamebreaking bugs that currently plague the game it will still be bad. Would not recommend.",0

The first 4 characters also have a team name in any combination but the rest of the characters dont.

Ended up softlocking my game twice and just having to restart it.

0,138255875,1940340,"It's a good game, can easily recommend it. 

That said, I have some criticisms about it. As someone who is a much bigger fan of the Jagged Alliance/XCOM genre, that aspect was the biggest reason why I liked DD1 so much, and it's the reason I can only say DD2 is ""good for what it is"". Graphics and animations aside, it feels like DD2 could've been a 20 dollar expansion rogue-lite mode for DD1.

I've played many rogue-lites with the FTL/Slay the Spire structure and while they're all addicting and fun, almost all of them suffer from the same fatigue induced by their repetitive nature. To me at least, there's a point in which it stops being rewarding and starts getting frustrating, not because of the difficulty but because of the inevitable cycle of starting over, by design. You don't have all the moves and characters unlocked at the start, you're supposed to fail and star over a few times before you're able to use the team you want, with the kit you want. DD1 was a repetitive game but the structure of the game was very good at creating the illusion of progress.

Both games have a similar loop but there are 2 major differences. The first one is that DD1 wasn't just a dungeon crawler, it was also a management-lite game and the entire ""rogue-lite loop"" was hidden behind it. DD2 feels more like just a ""game"", it's hard to describe. It gets rid of everything in between that created the illusion in DD1, so the end result ends up being a game that doesn't even tries to hide the fact that it's a game about doing the same thing over and over. It's kinda like the difference between Dead Cells and Hades. In Hades they manage to create the illusion that you're moving forward, in Dead Cells you're just starting over, even with all the meta progression elements. 

Another criticism I'd like to address is that I'm seeing comments like ""Oh it's much better because I don't end up losing 30 hours of progress like I did in DD1."" Well, in DD2 you lose 2 hours of progress, 30 times. It ends up being the same thing, the difference is that in DD2 if you lose, it's over. In DD1 you still had the ""struggle phase"" as I like to call, which is that moment in a run where you failed and are rebuilding your roster. Again, it sounds like you lost everything but to me at least, it feels like ""in universe"", every one you had died and you're now recruting and traning other recruits to make another push to the DD. To make a sports analogy, DD1 feels like you're rebuilding the roster, while DD2 feels like you're selling the team and starting another one from the scratch.

TLDR: I'm being able to see and enjoy DD2 for what it is, even though it feels like a step back from DD1. I can't shake the feeling that DD2 is just a fun distraction, but that deep inside I know I'll just go back to DD1 later.",1

Synopsis:  Grind low level worthless to you crap scattered all over a planet from dozens of past failed missions to level up the tech tree you should have LANDED WITH IN THE FIRST PLACE..

 Endlessly search for food, and blueprints because you were never destined to survive at all. Only the endgame tech allows for the growing of food, and proper control of temperature and atmosphere. 
You were sent to Mars to grind garbage...If thats your thing go get that turd game JunkPunk, its a master of mindless OCD trash grinding.

 There is no navigation, you get lost, game over. Yep, they sent robots to Mars that can navigate, but not for you stupid. You dont even get a HUD marker for your base. ( I built antennas, etc, no clue at all if there is a tech there, its buried in the tree at the end somewhere after the game ground me to death over and over three times. )

No tech is explained, and are not in a logical tree structure. Take food, the first three items you unlock in botany wont make food, Why? IDK, temperature, CO2, O2? anything could be the reason because the game doesn't give you any data at all, it just kills the plants. 

Time is screwed beyond redemption, I think I maybe get 6 hours a Mars day working time, Then I get to sleep twice for 8 hours, refilling water and O2 because my T-shirt and underwear space suit wont keep me warm enough to survive 18 hours of the cycle. No time control or managing sleep, your sleep cycle will be all over the place and you will be forced to sleep till 8 AM when you can briefly leave your habitat while the sun is up. The lights on the suit makes me laugh out loud, utterly worthless. If your in the dark your a cheat or your dead. If you do manage to get seedlings transplanted, a conveniently scripted solar event will ensure the plants die as quickly as possible. 1 microsecond without water or power and they are dead, so don't  swap a cable or try and adjust power levels in the transformer, if it cuts power to the circuit they are dead and there's no replacing lost seed.
This should be your first clue to bury this game in with the other dumpster fires. 

I did good for awhile, until the game decided to wipe my whole base out with a meteor storm, every solar panel destroyed, every corridor, every water plant, air tank, every building, and a debris field scattered with parts that would take two days in game to pick up. But I was fine hiding in the lander, facepalm..  I had not found the BP for meteor defense....Still cannot get any food to grow, CO2 scrubber and other systems have complexities that have no description or clue to use, YouTube is worthless with 2 year old videos from free demo's. They are all of the same hour or so of game-play, where everyone that has played this game reached a point of disgust and just deleted it. The Wiki has zero information because not even the developer knows wtf is going on in his game.

Boring, Confusing, Uninspiring, Unoriginal in every aspect, reminds me of that other failed Mars survival game Stationeers. Tutorials are worthless, teach nothing useful. I missed a lot, trust me, this game will only make you want to slap the developer across the mouth.

0,138257196,758690,"I only have 99 minutes of play on this and only got through the tutorials that are required for the first part of the campaign. When you get to the mission of escaping Alpha base I got soft locked 12 times. I can't even send in feedback cause it just says stuck at sending. In no way I can recommend this cause at this point in time the developers are scamming the players from this game. I thought there was good potential but if you can't even complete the first mission to being soft locked is it even a game, not to mention they say you can send feedback, but it just sits there on sending.... I literally left and cooked dinner and came back to the same message of sending for feedback on the screen and that was 2 hours.

Edit: Ok after getting passed the very first mission/tutorial the game opens up. It does get better and show it's true potential as a game. The game is not very friendly at the beginning and yes there is bugs, but it tells you as you load up the game. I still have issues with the feedback screen. I would recommend this game if you love base building in general. SOMETHING has to be done about the tutorial there. It is god awful abysmal and will put you to sleep as well as collision in this game is a bit wonky. Also use the grinder to get rid of blueprints before starting them.

Graphics are great

Pace is good

Variety of tech trees to focus on for replay/variable strategies

Unique buildings for each race/type if you will

The item drops are kind of generic, I wish they had a better variety that you get from exploring.  But I a sure some modders could improve this area.

After 7h I only just finished my first game. So far I haven't encountered any bugs, the game runs fine, the UI (for a super complex game) is very convenient. Everything is in the right place. Even little details are implemented in a way that just makes sense.

E.g. when manually saving the game (there is autosave as well), the savegame name defaults to something along the lines of ""important turn XY"" to distinguish it from the autosaves. Of course you can change the text, but the default one makes sense and manually saving a game becomes a very quick two click affair.

Or another detail: When starting the game you have the option (right away, before the game loads) to continue your last game. It even shows you the name of your last savegame. Click that button, and without having to skip any menus the game boots straight into the last savegame. Compare that to Forza Horizon, where you CAN'T EVEN HAVE different savegames, and which makes you wait 5x before you actually sit behind the wheel.

The level of polish and lack of bugs and inconveniences alone is a miracle in AAA games these days.",1
0,138258041,1669000,"I've played for about 15 hours and so far it has been a ton of fun. The game feels really polished, I haven't encountered a single bug yet and performance has been decent. It can definitely slow down a bit during large sieges but it doesn't bother me too much given that this is a turn based game. Turn times are also fairly quick, probably quicker than Civ 5/6.

The environments and enemy designs look great which makes exploring a joy. The UI is also pretty good although not perfect. For example I wish I would not have to confirm every turn that a unit should continue on the path I set before without turning off notifications for that unit altogether. The game also features the same tool-tip system as CK3/Victoria 3 which makes learning the game easy. You can just hover over any word you do not understand and a popup with more information will open. 

I didn't love the combat at first but the more I'm playing the more I get into it. Choosing buildings in your city also feels meaningful with many building providing more creative bonuses than just +10 gold/mana/whatever.

A highlight is definitely the option to create your own race. I think Stellaris is still the gold standard in that domain but for me AOW is right behind it. By finishing games you also unlock some more visual customisation options which is a nice incentive to keep playing. I wish more games would do something like that. 

Speaking of finishing games, another thing I like about Age of Wonders 4 is that games do not overstay their welcome. A single game might last 100 turns until it is over. The smaller scale helps avoiding the late game slog endemic to this genre, where you just throw doom stacks at the AI until you get to bored to continue.  

As a standalone game, this is better than the Civilisation games in my opinion. Granted, no one play these games without DLC, so I hope this games also receives enough post launch support to keep it fresh. It would be nice to see this game do well and establish itself as another household name for strategy fans.",1
0,138257766,1669000,I have been playing Age of Wonders Series since the original back in the late 90s. This is an excellent addition to the series and should be part of every strategy gamer's library. Triumph Studios is a wonderful company that should be supported.,1

Have you ever thought that furries were socially acceptable? Do you actually like spending hours and hours fighting against players and AI just to lose everything in the end because you probably aren't as good as the people who play this online? Then this game may be the one for you!

0,138258609,1651490,"So far Tiny Life is still in Early Access. Even being in Early Access, it's already such a good game! I can't wait to see what happens to it in the future.

It takes obvious inspiration from The Sims. And I think it does The Sims very well! It brings the flavours of The Sims but also feels unique in its own right! The visuals and music are reminiscent of The Sims (1), the open world from The Sims 3, the emotions and conversations taking a lot from The Sims 4. It brings all the things I love about The Sims series into one game!

The game allows you to choose pronouns for your characters. The game also has a very interesting trait system, which I have not seen in other Sims-like games, where you are limited in selecting a few traits, but then there are traits that you can select as much of as you want! It's a very good way to get around the limited traits issue, and allows the characters to have traits like asexual, aromantic, and diet preferences like veganism, while also having more personality oriented traits.

Most of my issues with the game could probably be addressed by the game being in Early Access. It does have some issues, I feel like when going into it, it can seem a bit clunky if you are too used to The Sims games, as it's a bit odd with picking up objects, however, you do get used to it though. I also feel like the build mode needs a lot of work. There is a pitiful selection of furniture to buy. The furniture that they do have is not really that fun; Since it borrowed a few visual elements from The Sims (1), I expected the furniture to be as fun and chaotic, as was in The Sims (1), however, it's more bland and boring. The character creation is also lacking, with not many options for clothing or traits. Fingers crossed in the future they have plans to have much more fun, interactive, and visually interesting furniture, and add more character customisation.

I might be getting ahead of myself by giving it a positive review when it's still in Early Access, but I think Tiny Life has done an amazing job of creating a solid foundation for a Sims-like game! Since I can't get my old Sims (1) CDs working on my PC, this has been a godsend!",1

0,138259534,1940340,"Most of negative reviews are just from people comparing two games together. That is not a review. When you look at this game as a standalone, it is really amazing experience. Would recommend 10/10 to anyone who likes roguelike and turn based battles. It's DD1 but more like Slay the spire and i absolutely love this combination. Best soundtrack and beautiful art style. This game doesn't deserve this rating at all, do not let those poor guys stop you from plying this. They are just hurt because they didn't get their DD1 remaster. Just give it a try. Enjoy it <3",1
0,138259253,1940340,"One of my favourite parts of DD1 is throwing together a fun, synergetic party out of your growing roster of heroes. You were able to train them in the exact skills they required by spending gold, and you could stack as many of the same hero type as you wanted.

In DD2, party building is extremely restricted in comparison. You can not have multiple of the same hero type in your party. Unlocking new skills for your heroes takes hours and hours of gameplay, you need to find a certain location during your run and select a single hero in your party to learn the next skill in their linear progression. In addition, the game gives you no information on locked skills other than their name, which makes it really hard to pick which hero will get the new skill unlock when you actually find the location required to unlock a new skill.

DD2's only resource for unlocking everything other than skills is called candles. Candles can be used to upgrade heroes and unlock new ""paths"" for them. You can select a path for a hero which provides passive buffs and debuffs that compliment using the hero in a certain way. Some paths completely change how a hero can be used, and its a great addition to the DD formula. However, the issue with paths is that a lot of them are only useful once you unlock most, if not all skills for a hero, as many paths buff skills you won't have unlocked, or compliment playstyles you can't use because you don't have useful skills for it.

For the sake of speeding up the rate you discover new parties and experiment with new builds, these systems need to be swapped. Hero shrines should not unlock skills, they should unlock paths. 

There are 11 heroes that can unlock skills with hero shrines, and 5 skills to unlock per hero. That's 55 hero shrines required to unlock all skills, which is an insane time investment compared to unlocking skills in the first game. There are only 3 paths per hero, on the other hand.

The player should be able to see all the skills and their effects for each hero laid out in front of them on one screen, and then pick and choose which to unlock by spending candles. This would do wonders for the amount of build variety available to the player towards the start of the game. Then, during a run, players can unlock new paths for their heroes, which will bring them back to unlock new skills they may not have had a use for before. 

It's honestly a little disheartening to think of how long you would have to play the game before being able to experiment with every build possible. Keeping skill unlocks behind hero shrines as opposed to candles is, in my opinion, either a huge oversight, or a purposeful choice to make the game grindier and keep people playing for longer.

To me, this game would be worth sinking dozens of hours into if only I could actually experiment with builds. The issue is that I will be spending dozens of hours of gameplay just to get to the same level of variety that DD1 with much less time invested, which is a really big step back for the gameplay.",0
0,138258932,1940340,"A real step back from DD 1. The caravan motif is fine, but suffering through steering it and watching it move through a very mediocre and uninteresting flame-scape really puts a drag on the pace of the game. Starting a fresh game at the alter of hope, and then watching the carriage trundle through some black blue flames just so you can pick the characters for your run, followed by another trundle through the flames is... annoying at best.",0
0,138258832,1940340,"Definitely not the same as the first Darkest Dungeon.  I didn't like the new mechanics and made the game less fun.  The challenge is different, and overall it's easier because there's no longer risk of losing your characters.  

Loot doesn't carry forward, you're basically starting over each time or at the mercy of the randomizer when you're trading candles for the next journey.

The Stage Coach is a neat addition, but there isn't really much gained by steering, so it was kind of pointless.",0

This game is a prime exsample of how to get some money, and deliver almost nothing.

They have all the right ideers, and this could be a great game, but this is a long way from anything that you can ask money fore. 

Way back when, when we had alfa and beta testing of games, the game developers used the alfa testing to find the last small bugs  in the game before reales to main market. The reason was that if the game was not resived well, the game would have a ruff time rebouncing.
Now evry new game is realised in early access, and the games get futher and further from a finished game.

But this game is just 2 dollars and it already has some big things going for it. I loved the gameplay as it was simple yet fun because how the enemies could spawn differently, plus it uses each weapon well and its a fun and easy learning curb. But I don't understand how to beat the boss at the end, and it still barely gives good instructions in the game besides the guns. The graphics are also good and fit a game like this. And plus you can play with other people on a different map with a whole different type of wave structure but with the same enemies. Now I did had some bugs like the hands being bugged when picking up grenades and I even fell through the floor once. But these sometimes don't happen or effect too much of the game. I do think I have some suggestions like adding more modes of course but adding endless wave mode, and maybe try to release a way for people to make their own maps just like how Vertigo 2 does it well. Also add more guns like a shotgun, plus a sniper for a whole different mission where you shoot the bugs far away. Also please make a discord server for this community as it would give more and better feedback and people could group up in a game with discord. And maybe just add arms or even a full body and have maybe full smooth locomotion plus the teleport just to get to higher places while still being able to move pretty freely. But this game has some big potential as it is almost like a demo but cost money.

Overall, this is a pretty alright game. Accessible, fun, core gameplay is alright and satisfying. Music and art is pretty decent.

But that's the problem. It's just pretty alright, and there's a whole slew of games out there that fit this bill, and this definitely doesn't feel much like a Darkest Dungeon sequel. If you took away the returning classes and the narrator voice actor, there's no resemblence.

1. The game as-is is short. I finished it in 40ish hours, it would have been more like 30 if I would have immediately realized that boosting relationships = instawin early on.
2. Difficulty level is way down, and there's no variable difficulty levels beyond an optional ""give me all the debuffs"" equipment you can spend a bunch of in-game $$$ on to unlock. If I were to replay the game I have no doubt I'd be able to beat each chapter on my first try without significant difficulty.
3. A lot of the charm and decisionmaking that made DD great is gone. You steadily heal as you travel, stress heals are abundant and there's no longer heart attacks. You no longer need to decide whether to abandon a quest and take the stress and loss of potential $$$, as you'll almost always be at full health and if you die... well, you don't really lose anything.
4. Related to point #3, there's nothing that encourages you to use other characters. If anything the game encourages you to keep using the same characters, as it's trivial to beat the whole game with the default crew and each time you unlock a chapter you keep quirks on any surviving characters and can unlock persistent boons for them.
5. A lot of the bosses are heavily overtuned. Not to a ridiculous degree but largely if you go into the battles not knowing what to expect, you WILL lose the first time. 

Overall, worth a play but at $30 for DD1 owners and $40 for everyone else, absolutely not. The game either needs heavy rebalancing to help bring back some of the DD1 charm as well as actually adding some variable difficulty levels, or it will be delegated to ""Probably worth 15 bucks"" territory forever.",0
0,138262191,1940340,"In its current state, this is a ""buy on sale"" game. I am recommending it because it is fun in small doses, but it lacks full retail value compared to the vanilla edition of DD1.

I put about 100 hrs into early access to give feedback and it struck me that big game design bets did not pay off the way the devs intended. The game is wishy-washy on how tactical it wants to let you be, and with lack of boss variety + RNG on what regions and loot you do get, there is no incentive to deviate from your party of choice while you brute-force your way to the chapter boss in a run that will be 95% like any other run.

The good:
------------------------------------------------
* Beautiful character/monster design and animations

* The token system makes it easier to plan rounds in advance, as hits are usually automatic unless a token changes the odds

* Hopping from battle to battle doesn't require the same attention as DD1 (no trap disarming), so the game lends itself better to multi-tasking

* Some of the foley work for growling was done by a pug


What I was looking forward to, but needs refinement:
------------------------------------------------
* The combo system is a cool evolution from the ""mark"" of DD1. Combos have variety, but it doesn't feel like there are enough synergies across classes, some seemingly opting out of combos entirely.

* Again, I like the tokens, but the game needs to commit on how transparent the odds are on other mechanics, like meltdowns or relationships. Or enemies that always get an extra action at the beginning of each round.

* Relationships extend how stress and play choices affect your party (neat, makes me feel more invested), but a lot of the mechanics still feel obtuse or outright nonsensical, like a character joining up in an inn mid-run and then completely hating everyone.

* Many class mechanics require you to charge up, cooldown, or combo skills to unlock their potential, but bosses usually require dedicated ""roles"" and very specific strategies (such as always hitting rank 4 twice a round), so the most fun stuff skill-wise happens on trash. Boss fights feel more dependent on your loot, than your skills.

* Back stories are cool, but the combat engine is a terrible, clunky vehicle in nearly every chapter in which it is employed.

The bad:
-------------------------------------------------
* The boss variety is in having 5 Big Bads; the mini-boss never changes for a region. This makes 95% of runs feel identical, even though you are technically progressing through the game. DD1 flipped things around, with a single endboss and multiple regional bosses, and is stronger for that.

*  Because you use a single party for an entire run, you cannot tailor your characters to the regions ahead. There is no pinch hitting from region to region (other than the bounty hunter randomly showing up) - all you can do is change your skills and gear. Because your party needs to handle all situations and enemy types equally well, you tend to settle with whatever party you find that works and bail on runs with regions that won't work.

* Cursed skills are locked to your payload, and that feels more punishing than it already is. This should be an option tied to a torch

* Many animations go on too long, such as the drummer and the the General's vines

* There is a lot of UI cognitive load that needs culling, such as inaccessible paths on the map

* Most of the regional music feels like placeholders. The score just isn't as strong this time around.

* The achievements are uninteresting and do not encourage interesting gameplay


Final thoughts
-------------------------------------------------
It's frustrating how stagnant DD2 feels to me in this new format, because RNG heavy rogue-likes like Slay the Spire inspire me to constantly try new things and get out of my comfort zone. But Slay the Spire also has a lot more variety and choice baked into every map node, whilst DD2 is extremely shallow once you pile into the stagecoach.

I think what irks me the most is the vibe around failure. In DD1, bailing on a mission usually meant you did not plan well. In DD2, bailing on an expedition usually means you didn't get the region or trinket you wanted. You don't get to experiment and learn from your failures in DD2, which is ironic, given the framing of the game.",1
0,138262167,1940340,"Darkest Dungeon 2, to me, does not feel like a sequel to the first, it's gameplay loop and progression feels unearned and tedious as you try your best to through what corpses of characters there are at a large steel wall until it opens up with the hundreds of candles you have to invest into characters and items. When I first played this game I compared it to Hades since the system of learning the game's lore, items, and progression are tied to the runs you have committed. This system works well in some regards, but with Hades you can do one clean run of the entire dungeon and beat the game. In this game it is virtually impossible with the game's agonizingly bad RNG.

Bosses don't feel like a challenge anymore and simply feel like a insurmountable nuisance. The game places all the goodies at the end of the rainbow while you trudge through a deep valley of crap to get to it. Nothing feels fulfilling anymore because why bother? Just restart your run, moron. It's not fun and downright annoying to do so.

The game's strongest merits are it's great visual style, effects and sounds. I was looking forward to this game since it got announced, but after screwing me over for the thirtieth time I think I had my fill. I hope Red Hook continues to make great games and continue to update this one. Unless they revamp some gameplay-related features I do not see myself coming back to Darkest Dungeon Two anytime soon.",0
0,138261917,1940340,"In my opinion, Darkest Dungeon II is getting way to many negative reviews for ""straying from the original formula"" or whatever.  That's nonsense -- and as huge fan of the original with hundreds of play hours, I do not say that lightly.  This game has been a blast to play.  Not only are the visuals and animations a lot better, but the game also feels like the result of a long, concerted effort to identify the weaknesses of the original and fix them, while at the same time keeping what worked in the original game.  To name a few examples:

- Healing was way overpowered in the original, the vestal in particular.  With the right trinkets, you could just spam Divine Comfort and pretty much out-heal the incoming damage most of the time.  Healing is much more balanced in Darkest Dungeon II -- the healing you receive in between combats is much more significant, in-combat healing is limited, and there is also a meaningful choice between different healing skills, healing items, and defensive support skills.

- In the original, you were HEAVILY disincentivized from experimenting with new party lineups and tactics, even though that was one of the most fun aspects of the game!  Darkest Dungeon 1 trained you to always play extremely conservatively and stick to low-risk strategies that worked in the past.  In Darkest Dungeon 2, even a party wipe is not that consequential, so you have the freedom to experiment aggressively and take risks, which is a lot of fun.

- In the original, I found myself nearly always choosing the same four skills for each hero class, once it became apparent what those were.  I might occasionally swap one or two skills if I was using a marking party or a dancing party, but that's about it.  In this game, the hero path system makes the skill choices quite a bit more dynamic and balanced.

- One of the most frustrating things about the original was that your hero roster would basically get ""locked in"" once your heroes reached a certain level.  You had to invest a ton of gold (= playtime, basically) into upgrading the weapon, armor, and skill levels of each individual hero, which was a strong incentive to keep using the same ones over and over again, with the same skills and even the same trinkets.  The expeditions would get rather grind-ey and repetitive before long.  In Darkest Dungeon II, those investments go to the entire *class* instead.  Plus the trinkets, hero affinities, quirks, encounters, and so on get randomized with each expedition, which keeps things interesting.

Another thing I rather disliked about the original was the inventory limit.  You NEVER had enough inventory space to keep all the treasure you found, unless you did something really stupid like throwing away food, shovels, bandages, torches, etc.  (As mentioned above, the game trains you to play conservative and bring extra of everything.  Skimping on food, torches, or shovels was a total non-starter.)  Basically you'd end up playing this weird minigame where you'd clear out the dungeon leaving some of loot behind,  clear the expedition goal, then discard your shovels/torches/whatever to free up a couple more slots and then backtrack for that loot.  Darkest Dungeon II has some inventory management, but it's much more reasonable because you're never forced to throw away the actual mission objective (i.e. candles).

I'm sure there are even more examples, but I think I've made my point.  This game really does improve the original in almost every way I can think of!  The one possible exception might be the climax of game.  In the original, once you actually obtained enough power to raid the Darkest Dungeon with your very highest-level heroes at stake, that was a truly unforgettable moment.  I don't know what happens at the end of Darkest Dungeon II.  I'm hoping it might be something similarly compelling, but that would be a very tall order.",1
0,138261719,1940340,"If you liked DD1 for it's in-depth base management plus battle system you will be understandably let down due to the removal of the former. I very much enjoyed the battle system of the first game but always feel burnt out when everything is opened up. 

But if you are like me, who found the base building/management in DD1 too overwhelming, DD2 is exceptional. The more classic rogue-lite approach will ensure every run, even failed ones, can net you resources to make your next runs a bit easier. The first game is more in line with XCOM, and the second one is more in line with Slay the Spire. 

It's definitely a game that is more streamlined and simplified compared to the first. However this doesn't mean it's bad or not fun. The battles are as engaging and enraging as ever, art/music are also on point.",1

It made me want to get a refund! Ammo spawns at the beginning of the co-op feature, is janky, vehicle controls, are janky, hit boxes to interact, JANKY!! There's no difficulty feature, so you can't set an easy, medium or hard difficulty, which sucks if you're new to this kind of game. The concept of the game is great, and my friends and me had a lot of fun and a lot of laughs, so we'll no doubt be keeping an eye out for future updates, but there's plenty that still needs fixing.",0
0,138262829,1159690,"Played the Demo, and the game seemed to merit trying it out on early access. Now with early access here, I'm still enjoying what they're put together so far. 

The only real question: Is it worth your time? For me, I'd say yes. It's an interesting theme, and if you have enjoyed similar games, this one does a nice variety of things to spice it up. 

The gun mechanics are decent, and the modding aspect adds a ton to the gameplay. Would I like more individual parts, or more ways to mod? Sure. The way it is now works, but I could see them expanding what's available. 

Train building itself is neat. Again, and always, I'd like to see a larger breadth of things to make on the train, more ways to customize, more nuance, more lighting (please, it's always so dark inside). But again, it's still early access and that's more or less what I'd expect to see. Even so, there's actually kind of a lot you can do with what you're able to work with, so it's not bare bones by any means. Miniature decorations and cosmetics would be nice. More divisions in each car, etc. 

If you're wondering if you should actually get this or not: Yes, it's worth your time already. Even the hop from the demo to the early access is a nice look into how much more there is to do inside the game. Is it done? No. There's plenty of stuff to do, obviously. You really REALLY shouldn't be coming into an early access game looking for a completed product though. That's sort of in the name. Despite that, this is still enough fun/interest that you can have a good time. Once the game is fully completed, hopefully they've fleshed it out with enough to  justify actually pushing for 100 or even 1000 runs.",1

0,138262745,1155330,"THE GOODs

- This game has graphics, sound, voice over almost at the level of AAA games, except there are no bugs (or at least I didn't encounter any)
- The game may seem like a slightly simplified Xcom, but the levels are handcrafted and they are all close quarters and often have additional goals. So in general they are even more fun than your average Xcom battles.
- It has an exploration phase similar to Mutant Year Zero, but with puzzles. I liked them and they fit the theme and atmosphere well, but be warned if you are not into such activities.
- The story is pretty generic, but the characters are likable and presentation is top notch.
- It has RPG elements, like character upgrade trees, sponsor perks, reputation and they are well-integrated.

THE NOT-SO-GOODs

- Half of the game you have only 3-4 characters available and its the same characters every time. You collect all the characters only in the end, when like 20-30% of the story left and you get them already upgraded. I hope more options will be added later, because it seems like a cut feature.
- Some weapons deal elemental damage to specific enemies but their base damage is so small that it makes no sense to use them. A wasted opportunity, but not a big issue.
- You can miss optional maps, which are quite good. Luckily they warn you when you are going to exit the area.
- Practically no replay value, no changes possible except difficulty. But you get 20-25 tightly packed hours if you explore everything.

THE UGLY
None. The game is good and worth the price.

Player spell casting which can impact your units through permanent enchants and mutations, the world and tiles, enemy armies; 

Unit battles are grid-based, turn-based combat which is just as competent as others in regards to skill and unit variety, also player combat casting here too;

Unique civilization creation, lots of fantasy races to choose from as a base, with different ruling types and affinities, traits which will influence everything about your play and the roleplay you'll have with other rulers.

[b]Far Cry 6 is a fun but mediocre game, and Ubisoft continues to treat Steam users like crap[/b]
In short:
- There's no modular download. If you download Far Cry 6 regardless of edition, you will end up with a 170 GB game. You can remove the DLC, languages and HD texture pack (46GB!) after that by manually going through the files and removing them. My current installation is 118GB after removing the other languages and the HD pack. I haven't removed the DLCs though.
- There's no Steam achievements. This is just another effortless port from Ubisoft and goes to show how much they care about their Steam users. Ubisoft spoke out against Steam's business practices and partnered up with Epic Games Store to exclusively sell FC6 on Ubi and EGS. Look how well that turned out! ([i]P.S.: Thank you for beta testing the game, EGS and Uplay users! Now we get a feature complete game for $15-$35 while you paid astronomically high prices for a mediocre game![/i])
- The game itself has great performance, runs well on Linux and Steam Deck, Denuvo DRM doesn't seem to interfere with this
- The story is mediocre, it has its ups and downs
- The characters are alright, some are great (Anton & Diego Castillo, Dani have great voice acting) and some are bad (Maximas Matanzas are annoying)
- The open world is filled with things to do for maybe 10-20 more hours after you finish the story, but it doesn't really feel alive, and it cannot be compared to even GTA San Andreas or GTA IV
- The NPC AI is basic and easy to outrun or manipulate
- The classic overused Ubisoft formula is still here, although that doesn't mean the game can't be fun

[h2]My experience[/h2]
[b]Playtime[/b] - pre-Steam (running on Lutris), 65 hours; post-Steam (running on Linux, ProtonGE), 18 hours (as of the time of review)

[b]Story[/b]
The story is fine, it's nothing special though. The player gets on a boat with their friend, Anton Castillo boards the boat, finds Diego which was trying to run away, kills everyone, but Dani is 'the lucky one' as they manage to escape. They join Libertad and in the end kill Anton Castillo. After leaving Isla Santuaria, the player gets a choice and can choose to start doing missions for any of the 3 'factions' Libertad needs to kill Anton. I always seem to go Monteros > Maximas Matanzas > The Legends, but you can choose to go any other way.

[b]World[/b]
The world is filled with quests, collectibles, loot and enemies. It can be both fun and terribly boring to crunch through all these things if you want to get 100% completion. I started a new playthrough on Steam and I'd say I'm ~30% complete in 18.5 hours. The world doesn't really feel dead, but it doesn't feel alive either. It cannot live up to the standards from games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas or Grand Theft Auto IV. No game seems to get anywhere near these, outside of Rockstar.

[b]Characters[/b]
The characters are mostly alright. Clara Garcia, Dani, Espada & Alejandro Montero, and of course Anton & Diego Castillo are the most likable characters in my opinion. There's not that much backstory to any of them, and I'm fine with that. I don't need long expositions about how their life was before the Castillos started their dictatorial regime. Some characters like Yami and Maximas Matanzas are annoying to me. Yami will always repeat her voice lines when re-doing races, or while you're racing. Maximas Matanzas simply aren't that likable, their singing is terrible and their romantic kisses are cringe-worthy.

[b]'AI', NPCs[/b]
And because this is a Ubisoft game, their AI/NPC behaviors are pretty mediocre but consistent across the board. Even on the highest difficulty it's easy to fool, outrun and even become invisible to the enemies. There's not much variety in what the enemies can do, and even the enemies used in DLCs or in the free content (e.g. The Vanishing) aren't really that different outside of a different model.

[b]The Vanishing[/b]
I have to mention The Vanishing especially, as a huge Stranger Things fan. This free content update was amazing, and I'd love to see more, either in FC6 or FC7. Basically Dani meets with an old woman that has telekinetic powers because of the experiments the russians did on her, and through a bunker in Yara we can travel to the 'Shadow Place' to rescue Chorizo from the Demogorgon, nicknamed 'El Devorator'. We'll also see and interact a little with the Mind Flayer / Chernobog. The enemies are either reskinned soldiers speaking russian or 'zombies' that are just melee enemies named 'kukly'/the flayed. The crossover DLC has a short but interesting story, and it was a great experience overall.

[h2]Linux, DRM[/h2]
Before FC6 released on Steam I have run the 90GB (no languages other than English, no HD pack, no Deluxe/GOTY content) a year ago through Lutris, and outside of a few performance hiccups, it ran between 50-60 FPS on Low + FSR Ultra Quality @ 1080P on my GTX 1650. Steam's Proton (before 8.0) refused to run for me, so I used Wine-fshack.
After FC6 released on Steam, I have run the newly updated game (same modifications as before to save space) through Steam's Proton (8.0+) and Proton-GE (8.1) and it ran flawlessly at 60 FPS on Low + FSR Ultra Quality @ 1080P. I didn't need to use Lutris to play it anymore, which is good.

As for DRM, it uses Denuvo's cancerous garbage. It runs surprisingly fine on Linux even with the DRM, which is nice to see. I'd much rather recommend you install Linux and play it like this instead of having a kernel-level DRM on your Windows installation (and other reasons why Windows isn't really great).
Bonus, Far Cry 6 runs on the Steam Deck through Proton and Proton-GE as well! You can play the game on the go and get pretty good performance on low-medium presets.

[h2]Purchasing[/h2]
If you want to buy the game, buy it while it's on sale:
$15 - Standard Edition
$20 - Deluxe Edition (what I bought)
$25 - Gold Edition
$30 - ""Game of the Year"" Edition (even though FC6 did not win any GOTY awards)
I [b]do not[/b] recommend buying the game at pricing higher than this. $100+ for the GOTY edition is absolutely hallucinating. That's the equivalent of at least 500 RON in Romania, which is, for most people, the combined price of monthly utilities (gas, water, electricity, phone bill, Internet connection, cable TV subscription, etc), or even rent. I would never imagine spending that much money on a game edition that adds one more DLC that sucks anyways.

[h2]What's next?[/h2]
With all the DLC and updates having been released before FC6 arrived on Steam, I don't think there will be any more updates to the game outside of bug fixes and patches, if needed.

What's next as a game? Far Cry 7 is already in development at Ubisoft, and will probably be released in 2025 or 2026. As for me, I'll probably attain 100% completion in the following days/weeks, then to possibly promptly uninstall it from my 500GB hard drive.",1

The character roster are diverse in terms gameplay mechanics and the basic controls are easy to understand. The visuals are great, from the characters to the stages. I feel like Arcade Mode could benefit from an overhaul or rework, like randomized character roster for each fight instead of a preset, and a difficulty option to make the Arcade Mode fresh and replayable, [spoiler] instead of opting out for the Story Mode which takes a long time to finish and introduces power up mechanics that some players might not prefer. [/spoiler] Overall, a pretty good fighting game for beginners to pick up and play and not be overwhelmed by complex mechanics.

Personal complaint is that the normal grab/counter grab feels a bit clunky, [spoiler] or maybe that I'm just bad at playing grapplers to begin with lol. [/spoiler] I also kinda wish that there's an option to reduce the some of the details/background details like the Bar Stage, definitely too much going on for me which distracts me from time to time [spoiler] (especially when playing the heavy setup Sora) [/spoiler] and overall lags the game in that stage, but that's just me.",1

0,138265631,1940340,"I was on the fence between giving it a positive or a negative review but after it TWICE losing all my progress because it either. Crashing, Computer turning off, or anything that would close the application in anyway shape or form; That just causes it to super corrupt your save and it doesn't try any fall backs. I had to go dig for one that was multiple hours old so I don't even know what's lost. Put 15 hours in so far and have only about 6 of actual progress due to 2 separate times of losing all my data. 

So going into the actual game

The game is way different then the first game with this one trying to be more Roguelike rather then the Campaign sorta thing you had going on in the first one so to a point you really just feel like you are slamming your head into the wall over and over and over until you get enough upgrades to things to actually be able to take fights to try and avoid the enemies having deaths door mechanic now too and that just RNGing you so badly it just feels unfair. Combat is mostly like the first game but some things are changed and a lot of them don't feel good enough to use over others anymore. This one can also RNG you out of your run way harder now with the relations mechanic and enemies having death door as well as debuff spam.

I wanna like it but losing progress twice due to the game not having a proper saving mechanic is ruthless.",0

0,138265741,2001340,"Do you like turn based JRPG combat? Then you should absolutely play this game, it has some of the best around. Do you not like turn based JRPG combat? You should play this anyways, it might change your mind. It has you juggling a large group of characters, each of which use one of 3 weapon types with their own spin on it, in and out of three active turrets on your supertank. Effectively you have a party of three active characters (plus three support characters, each assigned to one of the active roles) at a time all operating off of the same hp/mp bar for the tank. You can rotate who is in what slot on the fly giving a huge degree of flexibility in how you can approach a situation.

Of course Fuga has a lot to love about it besides just the combat, though that is the main thing you will be doing in it. The cast of characters are all likable, the art is charming, and the story hits some good emotional beats. Said story follows a group of children as they pilot a supertank to fight against a new threat to save their friends and their country, struggling along the way with the pursuit of revenge. Also they're all french and furries.

One thing to note is that this game is a sequel, and while it has a recap on the main menu for the first game it doesn't do a great job of telling you what all happened.

0,138265135,1681840,"An utter gem in the flood of deck-building games. This developer has put a lot of thought into his design decisions, and the result is a refined, strategically deep game that is well worth full price, despite what some other reviews say.

I thought I would hate the ""cards are finite"" system of resting to restore your deck, but it's great! It's also offset by a few things: first of all, you usually win at least one card from each battle. Second, there are passive summoner abilities and consumable items that restore cards between battles. Third, you have a party of units with their own attacks and abilities to utilize in lieu of expending cards. Fourth, the resources needed to rest are plentiful even when you DO burn a lot of cards in a tough fight. Every card played feels like a commitment, but it never feels oppressive and actually adds new tactical considerations. If you're reading this and, like me, you're hesitant because of that system, try it! You'll be pleasantly surprised.

Card balance and value is also the best I've seen in any deck-builder short of Slay the Spire or Monster Train, thanks mainly to the lack of (apparent) card rarities. Without going into too much detail, suffice to say the system works very well, and there's no power creep: every card feels useful in some way, and there's a lot of room for synergies. I also like the unit-heavy selection of cards, which speaks to my inner pet class.

0,138265909,2349830,"I really can't complain TOO much, the game's only a buck, but yeah no, this ain't it chief. 

Let's start with the positives, because there's a lot to like here. For one, the game is great on the eyes and ears: the pixel art is well done, the music is wonderful, if very limited, and enemies pop out from the background very nicely. 

Then, there's the gameplay. Oh dear.

I have several massive problems with the gameplay, but in short: it's Vampire Survivors with barely anything that made me like it so much: no macrogame progression, the weapons feel weak and clunky, and it commits the cardinal sin of the action roguelike: Getting a good run doesn't make me drunk with power. On the contrary, I just feel bored. The inventory system is cool, but when I could genuinely care less about half the weapons available, there's a problem. The character balancing SUCKS, dear lord, I don't think I've seen a roguelike character as truly abysmal as Remilia EVER. And even then, once you get past ALL of that, the game is just...dull. One stage, with the same flat background, playing the same music(though I will say, certified bop), with no consumables to pick up, only a few objects to obstruct movement, there's just not enough there. Which sucks, because there's a boatload of potential here: the inventory management is cool, spell cards function similarly to synergies in VS and add complexities to inventory, and there's certainly room for more, better weapons and better balancing, but right now, it feels like I'm staring into a massive bloody desert.

MAYBE the dev will inpreve the game in the future, and MAYBE this game will flourish into an amazing experience, but right now? I can't say I'm dissapointed, but I'm far, FAR away from being impressed.

Overall, a barebones, dissapointing VS-style game. I really hope this game can get some good updates to put some meat on those bones, because right now you might as well just cough up the extra money for Vampire Survivors.",0
0,138265881,2159650,"I think it wants to be raft in space.  The first game loop is collecting asteroids of different flavors, which is fun for maybe 10 minutes.  The next game loop is exploring for crystals.  For this, you leave your ship with limited oxygen, power, and food.  Also, you have very limited inventory slots and 2 of your 3 needed resources don't stack.  You look for bigger asteroids that contain crystals for the next level of research.  It feels very RNG and tedious.  I think I found 2 of one type of color crystals in over 1.5 hour of searching.  I believe that each of the first tiers of research require 20 of 2 different color types.  I couldn't stay awake drifting from one asteroid to another, which appears to be the game loop.",0

Its not the absolute disaster that everyone says it is, I think everyone is just shocked that this game came from the same studio that produced fantastic games like Prey and Dishonored. It's worst sin is being criminally boring and basic.

0,138267039,1669000,"The date of this review is 5/13/2023.  

Game is addicting and very fun, when it works.  Singleplayer I have had no issues so far.  But multiplayer is a f*cking jumbled mess.  Literally at the start of every turn, desync, twice every manual combat, desync.  Opponents moving...game crashes.  We've been soft locked where everytime the opponents are moving, it would crash and would have to revert to the previous round or we CANNOT continue the game.  That being said, it will reset your awards if you've collected any during that previous round and I assume to prevent save scumming, the game would reduce your rewards as well (from what we've experienced).  Sometimes when the opponents are moving, my game would just freeze and I would have to task manager close it.  My buddy got a blue screen once during the frozen opponents are moving screen.

At the current time of this review if you want to play with friends, I really cannot recommend it.  You will spend about 40% of your playtime restarting the game and reverting rounds.  But if you do want to play it solo, I would say go for it, there is plenty of content for you to do with all the scenarios.  Faction creation is super neat too.  You have a decent amount of options to choose from.  

If you are not having the same problems as me, great for you because the game is amazing and a fun time with friends.",0

0,138268735,1940340,"I unfortunately can't recommend Darkest Dungeon 2. It's just not as fun or engaging as the first game. In fact I'd go so far as to say you might enjoy this game more if you've never played the first. 

The only area DD2 improves upon the original is presentation. The graphics and art style are both fantastic and provide a modern version of iconic DD1 aesthetic. Sound design is top notch and Wayne June once again does a phenomenal job delivering the game's excellent writing. 

Unfortunately the actual mechanics of the game have changed for the worse. The throw away carriage rides with no persistence don't compare to building up a town and a roster of heroes. Unlike in DD1 death means nothing in DD2 and runs can be abandoned whenever without consequence. There's no attachment to anything and the entire game devolves into a candle grind.

The strategic layer isn't the only disappointing new aspect. The combat itself has also taken a turn for the worst. Healing and destressing have been nerfed into near uselessness between DD1 and DD2. The core strategy for success is to maximise damage and end the fights as soon as possible. Add to that an increase in the randomness of battle and you end up with a system that is the very worst of the DD1 combat. This seems to be a consequence of the aforementioned throw away characters and runs. The devs have no real need to balance the combat so that a team of heroes can complete a run since there's no real loss if a run fails and the heroes die.

Lastly I feel like the game doesn't even do a good job at being a rogue-lite. The candle upgrades and unlocks aren't all that exciting and while I'm still fairly early game, none of the unlocks have really made me feel much more powerful and following runs easier. 

To conclude I recommend giving this one a pass or maybe get it on sale. If you already own DD1 you can get it discounted by 'completing the bundle' which will save you some money and maybe make giving this a try less of a gamble. I do hope we see a Darkest Dungeon 3. I love the themes and settings in the game and it's always fun hearing Wayne June again but I hope they take the series a different direction.",0

You no longer can spam heals with Vestal and instead actually need to think on who does what and when, which is hard, especially if your team is somewhat incoherent (just like mine is right now). Also animations and the way story is written are amazing. And not to mention how they changed so much in the game, instead of following DD1 formula, yet the game is coherent and keeps on giving.

0,138268080,1940340,Darkest Dungeon 2 is a good game but it is not exactly like the first one instead with a focus on team-composition and rouge lite elements,1
0,138267944,1940340,"The pacing is slow: even slower than the first. Combat also seems painfully difficult even compared to the original. A lot of heroes and a lot of individual skills, especially regen/sustain, just don't seem viable due to artificial limits on usage (I've unlocked maybe half of the skills that are on offer). Regular non-boss enemies often seem to have better synergies/skills than I can put together. Bosses are just ridiculous in what they can get away with, and feel more like DPS checks than any amount of skill can surpass.

The travel/world elements and intercharacter elements have a lot of conflicting priorities, and maybe I just suck at the game but I found it really hard to satisfy any of them reliably. Most options/trinkets/decisions have a downside and an upside, and quite frequently the downsides for ALL of them outweigh the upsides. That's OK to have to choose between multiple sub-optimal options once in a while, but the way this game does it it's like a steady downward pressure on anything you're trying to do.

I 25 hours in and I can't even reach the 2nd boss, and the first boss often kills at least one of my party. I'm no min-maxer but as a veteran gamer I usually do better.

Still, I'm enjoying myself. It's hard. I like hard. And I keep hoping that once I get past some more of the roguelite elements and unlock some abilities that will allow me to progress that I will start to make progress. But even if that's true, that just means they're artificially blocking progress behind a grind-wall. That might have worked for fast-action games like Dead Cells and Hades, but even if I'm having some (frustrating) fun I cannot recommend a game with this kind of slow pacing which chooses to block your progress like this. 

Stay away unless you read everything I said and still think it sounds OK.",0

The game had a development of five years, and Ill admit, I've only recently started following its development circa around Christmas as I have the attention span of a squirrel. In these five years, the worth was wait it. Alex and Taylor came up with such a beautifully developed game from its characters, soundtrack, and story, and I cant wait to see where the otome world will take yall!

So far in my twelve hours I have completed three routes and the good endings and bad endings have left me throughout entertained. This game has so far for me included several feel-good moments, but the bad endings packed a punch especially in Tom's bad ending(s). I was actually crying at several moments during my play through.

After two days of downloading 100+ gigs, I launch it, get ready to play and...

no sound. No intro music, no trailer music, no menu sounds or music, the only thing that actually exists is the 'menu narrator' voice.

This is disappointing to say the least. I was ready to throw away everything everyone had said about this being soulless and being just like the other Far Cry games, and it was ruined in seconds by the lack of anything I was supposed to be witnessing audibly.

It may actually be unfinished. Not sure.
One reviewed not long ago this game had no update from the E.A release since around a year.
And it has been finally fully released 2 days ago.
It also has been released with a 50% off. That may frustrate the people who potentially bought it a more expensive price during E.A. Not sure as well what was its price at this time.
But...

What I play for the moment amuse me.
Go on missions to save your crew and wage a war against the other clan of bum. The bugs.
Explore the city, find collectibles, materials to build your base that will be attacked on a regular basis, improve your skills such as you kamikaze pigeons... and the others. Your own traits as well.
Ride your best friend, a supermarket cart. Engage in clock races (the less interesting challenges btw).
Beg to get money to buy some proper food.
Attack Bugs clan to obtain blueprints to improve your base.
Take challenges such as big fingering cops to earn more. Then escape from their reprisals to avoid finishing in hospital and lose from your stash.

The game is fully voiced and that's funny, well done. The graphics are alright. The musics are very good. The mechanics are ok. Playability is good, not always but in general and when it is not, you should finally get used to it, nothing game breaking, no big deals, just little annoyances.
There are some really good and funny characters to meet. A story out of the clan war,
The survival part ""hunger, thirst"" are not a major component of the game. They requires to pay attention but don't force you to constantly run after that. Really good point IMO.

The main pains, the real ones, are, the invisible walls on the town borders. Some are the result of a lack of work. You see the end of a tunnel but you cannot get till there since an invisible wall is set quiet before that... The sign you need to write on with your controller or mouse in order to beg and that clean itself too easily following an unclear manipulation of it.
To build, you automatically get your materials from your cart. To repair, you need to take them out first and then apply...

It is a good game. It is funny, trash. At 50% off like today, it is definitely worth the laughs.",1

Its a pretty short game at ~30 minutes for the campaign, but that covers about 5 encounters with a pre-made party of a cleric, sorcerer, rogue, and fighter. You don't get to change anything about their classes, feats, or skills, but you really dont need to. You can switch out the characters weapons and consumables.

Unfortunately, we're Mac gamers, so Darkest Dungeon II's Windows-exclusivity was disheartening. We tried running using Parallels--the game was incredibly choppy as soon as we loaded it up.
After getting only a few frames and disjoint audio through the whole introduction cinematic, we were able to change the game settings to crank the graphics down to their lowest setting--the game was still incredibly choppy and laggy (probably 15 FPS at best).

We managed to get through the prologue before giving up. From the brief amount we saw, the gameplay looks like an interesting and welcome change from the original. Unfortunately, we'll have to return the game until it has macOS support. At a certain point, we feel like we're doing a disservice to the developers when we're playing the game so far from how they intended it to be played.

For frame of reference, this was attempted on an M2 MacBook Air running Windows 11 through Parallels Desktop for Mac. This machine has no problems running Mac-compatible games which are much more graphics intensive, such as Baldur's Gate III. We really hope that Red Hook ports this over to Mac!

Once you've got the basics down the game offers a lot of variety. There are some great features here. The most unique aspect this game builds on is the race customization. Each Race is comprised of their physical traits, their ruling style, and their magical focuses.

0,138270909,1494420,"I only play as a commander so I'll put that into view here. 

First of all, the UI is way to small for how many buttons there are present on the screen, of which there are not many at all so if stuff was a bit bigger would be nice, and on that same point the map is kind of ugly.

Another point I have is the complete lack of hotkeys present. I can't even assign units to Ctrl/Shift 1-10 so micro is basically impossible and there isn't an actual way to tell units to attack, they just move and attack whatever they want so its pretty clear they have been focusing a bit much on the FPS part of the game so I hope they make it more accessible for RTS only players.

0,138272359,1940340,"When I saw DD2, I was pretty ecstatic! Loved the first game and had coincidentally just started playing it again. This game is absolutely different from the first. 

First off, level design has changed dramatically. Rather than have a blank map in a dungeon where you move one tile at a time, now you steer a coach with a chance to spot what will occur in front of you. That may be a fight, an encounter with normal people for supplies, debuffs, etc. Furthermore, these paths lead to different ""rooms"" such as a supply runner to buy things, healers, more fights, etc. I personally preferred the map and dungeon system from the first game. Not a knock on this, I just think that feels more like a dungeon crawler where as this seems more like I'm choosing my own adventure type deal and waiting to go from room to room. 

Second, leveling is much different. There are no permanent unlocks for leveling armor, weapons and skills. Each ""expedition"" you choose your party and have limited points (spread throughout the expedition) to upgrade the skills of your party at the inns before and after each part of the mission. You also cannot change your comp or movesets mid expedition, so I find this one is even more trail and error than the first game. Some like that, some don't, just be aware of it. 

Third, unlocks are... interesting. I can't tell if I like it or not. Now you are choosing what heroes you unlock, as well as leveling them through ""memories"" that you can come across on your expeditions. You also can unlock new items to be found and new classes with a currency called ""candles of hope"" that you will find and earn throughout each expedition. This will in turn unlock different classes of the heroes. For instance, the man at arms has a class called ""Sergeant"", where he does less damage but has a chance to give better buffs and can take more hits. I don't know how many classes each hero has but its an interesting way of adding depth.

Fourth, there are now relationships between the characters that you have to attempt to build in order to make your squad function as efficiently as possible. Good relationships will yield extra vbuffs on certain moves, as well as the occasional extra attack. Negative relationships will lead to debuffs on important moves that hamper your ability to engage in combat. It could use some tweaking to make it easier to understand why or when a relationship changes, but ultimately I think its a fun exercise making sure your squad actually likes each other. 

I find myself torn on this game, especially as a sequel. On one hand, I enjoy the game for its art style, combat, and strategy (at least in the little I've played). It has a different type of charm when compared to DD1. However, I can't shake the feeling that if this wasn't marketed as a sequal and was a standalone, I probably wouldn't have bought it. There is a lot changed from the first one and I'm not sure its all for better or worse. This almost feels like comparing apples to oranges in how different these two games feel and play. 

Ultimately, if you enjoyed DD1, I think you will enjoy this. It takes getting used to for sure, but once you acknowledge you cannot play it exactly the same and start to explore it as a new game, I think there is a good amount to like. I think there is definitely some more tweaking to do and if you aren't sold on the game play changes you won't enjoy this. I still find DD1 to be the better game, but if you're looking for a similar experience, this is definitely one game you should check out.",1

0,138272265,1940340,"Please don't listen to the negative reviews. Those people wanted a remake of the original not something new. This game is very different, and I actually like it more than the first one. There was a lot of difficult bullshit in the first game that was completely unfair and rng dependent. A lot of the time, I didn't feel the first game cared about the progress you made because once your units are dead. Everything you worked toward is gone. This one leans more towards the roguelike genre, where you loop and start from the beginning each run. There is a nice progression system that actually gives a fuck about your time, even if you fail a run. Despite the massive difficulty, It's still very possible to complete your first run with good strategy. The affinity system is the only thing that is really bothering me at the moment, but it's just one of the many things you'll have to deal with in this punishing game. Highly recommend. Great sequel not a remake.",1
0,138272202,1940340,"Its almost there, but just  misses.  It a dang rogue lite....
They took a great game where you explored different zones, had characters you built on.  Now its a wagon ride with characters that reset every time.  You can unlock some abilities if you play some crappy mini games that do not tell you what to do.
The heroes are not balanced, get ready to die a lot.  Its supposed to be hard...but it takes it about 2 steps beyond that and makes is exasperating and frustrating.
A little easier, some more quest direction/flavor and you got something.

[list]
    [*]With that said, as a roguelite this game is very fun.
    [*]It's atmospheric, difficult, and satisfying.
    [*]The mechanics are easy to grasp because they're fairly intuitive and there are tutorials for everything.
[/list]

[b]The Bad:[/b]
[list]
    [*]I've only experienced one bug which resulted in a softlock for some reason. The Leper's Purge skill had the Target Team: Clear Corpse replaced with Target Team: Instant Kill. I was extremely surprised because it all seemed legit, but then an enemy just kept buffing itself over and over for 3 minutes with no turn rotation. When I relogged it happened again, so I abandoned. I went to pick Leper again then realized the skill wasn't actually supposed to be a full team insta-kill lmao.
    [*]At first it felt very grindy because you have to unlock every hero beyond the starting four. However, after getting decently far or after a couple of runs you can easily unlock every hero so this is essentially a non-issue.
    [*]I think the trinkets could use some refining or reworking. I find myself more often than not simply discarding the vast majority of them instead of accepting the benefits along with the drawbacks. Maybe that's a me thing, but it's worth mentioning.
    [*] Unlocking hero skills is painfully slow. That's really all there is to it. I think learning about heroes backstories is awesome, but there has to be a better way to do it, I'm sorry.

0,138272561,1230170,"The concept is wonderfully promising, but right now there is too many things with the game that are just irritating the heck out of me.

The game is mostly very linear as it's presented right now. There is no failure point, no branching points where the player can get creative in how to fix the gun. You got a broken part? Maybe you could fix it and restore it, swap it out with a new one or even ignore it completely, at the cost of reputation/money because you forgot about it. You need to have business related features to make it interesting, and maybe you can specialize and/or attract a certain demographic of clients, and compete with others, etc.. 

A good example is that in PC building simulator 2, you can make refurbished/pre-made computers with either used or new parts on top of the usual repair or spec jobs. Some players just make a bunch of cheap, affordable computers that sells easy or super high-end ones with greater profit margins.

There is none of that. The game is simply too straightforward to be interesting in the long run. The whole thing about gunsmithing is you have to get creative when trying to solve specific issues with a gun or maybe reach a certain point of performance (Like accuracy). Maybe you get a gun that has a lot of issues extracting and the client complains about it, and it's up to you to figure out what's wrong. Or maybe some dude wants to be able to shoot at 800 yards accurately, and you need to come up with a gun within a set budget and accessories that can be up to it.

Basically, you can't get creative at all. Get told X, Y and Z. Do X, Y and Z. Congrats, you've beaten the game. 

The gun disassembly process is a big one. Right now, the diassembly requirements, where you NEED to disassemble specific parts that has nothing to do with the job. Best example of this is the Mossberg 590A1 job, which basically only require to swap the synthetic forearm and stock with wood ones. So pretty much all i need to do is remove the forearm and stock, swap them out and done.

However, you absolutely need to remove and detail strip the entire trigger assembly and the front sight (?!?) for some reason, which has nothing to do with the job.

Then the woodworking part is janky and mostly useless. First of all, why do i need to woodwork a forearm and stock for a M590? It's an extremely popular weapon platform and you already find plenty of aftermarket or OEM wood stocks and forearms. The woodworking entirely skip crucial steps like hollowing out the forearm, it just magically go from being a solid piece of wood into a proper hollow forearm when you go to apply some wood finish.

Then there's all kind of little things like not actually ever cleaning the inside of barrels (You just swab the exterior of it with a rag and boom, clean barrel), somehow having to oil every little part you add to the gun (Why do i need to oil a fucking aluminium AK rail? Or stocks and pistol grips?)

So yeah. Concept is definitely promising and could really be interesting and fun if there is simply much more freedom to things.",0

0,138274275,2272970,"For only $5, what this game brings to the table is incredible. 

What the game does well, it does very well. The spritework is amazing, down to the subtle little details, like Gera squinting when their bright torch is illuminated right in their face, or their face showing shock at the sheer recoil of the shotgun when it fires. 

While the game is very punishing, and you can expect to die time and time again, never did I feel 'cheated,' be it by the physics or the enemies. Checkpoints are spaced out juuuuust enough for it to not feel like a walk in the park, but also it doesn't also deflate you when you die right before hitting one, as you are sent no more than 3 minutes back as a consequence.
 
The sound design works well to contribute a different feel to all three areas, especially considering there is only so much visual variation you can achieve with black and white.

The small IV drips of lore in the form of the notes really provide an emphasis to go out and explore. While not a super 'deep' story by any means, I really wanted to find out more about the fate of the other fellows that got trapped in this hole.

Some of the game's horror elements are also really well done. The exploding insect egg things made me jump in my seat a bit the first couple times they went off. The tension in area 2, as you swim closer to the big fish's lair is also very palpable, and it made me really dread descending deeper into the water.

HOWEVER, this game does have some very apparent shortcomings at the moment. Bear in mind that I have not gone for a true ending run, and I have been informed that the feel of the second and third areas are altered under these circumstances. My criticisms are based on my two very casual runthroughs of the game.

Firstly, it is VERY cryptic. I had to scour other reviews and patch notes in order to scrounge enough information to figure out what I had to do. 

Even then, getting a satisfactory ending in any short amount of time is impossible, as the true ending requires you to beat the game without dying. Considering I died no less than 50 times during a normal playthrough, seeing how it's really supposed to pan out seems like a pipe dream. 

There is also an extreme lack of any visually-distinct landmarks, which requires you to memorize the path to the next area in its entirety, which adds a lot of needlessly getting lost into the mix. 

The gun is also a hassle to fire, requiring a 3-button combo to get a shot off. This means it is almost impossible to fire on a whim, causing you to stand there, gun readied, waiting for any creature to find you. If you try to find them, by the time they pop into your tiny field of view, it is too late to take out, shoulder, and fire your gun.

The audio, while good in some respects, still sounds incredibly stock in others. Some sounds, like the really crunchy torch, serve to break my immersion every so often. I also know that a big motif of this game is insanity, but the use of the Shepard tone in one of the areas drove me insane for all the wrong reasons. I will fully admit that's a nitpick, though.

Finally, it's a bit unfortunate that many of the game's horror elements only really have a first-time impact. I understand that desensitization is a thing. After 1000 jumpscares, FNAF isn't really poop-your-pants scary. Nevertheless, I found myself becoming very at ease in these different environs as soon as my first death in them. There is very little in the way of tension build up through audio, and the only thing that works to keep you hesitant is the very low range of visibility. There is also generally only one enemy type per zone, which means you know exactly how they're going to behave as early as your second encounter. Given that a foundational principle of horror is uncertainty, this does not do much to keep the player on edge.

While it looks like I had more mean things to say than kind ones, I cannot stress enough how much fun I had playing this game. It's short, sweet, and infinitely replayable. Please spend $5 to support this developer. It is well worth it!

It's irritating that the abilities, consumables, and specializations that are important to progress are gated behind candles, although I don't see this as much different than how DD1 did it either.

Lots of people are bothered by the lack of a permanent roaster. Max level heroes dying in DD1 meant that you had to start the whole grind over to get them to the point that they were strong enough for bosses again (even accounting for the hamlet upgrades that could mitigate the grind).

For me, I like this game.  The 'grind' is a zen like experience which I found relaxing and I don't mind the research and smelting not reflecting real life, because it's a GAME. I wonder if the same moaners have ever played a game with magical characters and then moaned the next day because they couldn't cast 'Fireball +2 ' into a crowded bus stop across the road?

The graphics are good, it runs fine on my old laptop too, a core i5 GTX 1050. 

The story line is... up to you to discover. I like the voice-over humour  too.

This is a  floaty,  trippy  train ride of a game, with the aforementioned  'grind'  in the Void interspersed with off the train antics for you to get up to. 
Yes it needs a little improvement here and there, but it's in a perfectly playable  state and that's more than can be said for many early access games. The developers should be encouraged through early access times, not slated.",1
0,138273661,1159690,"So far I would give this game a solid 6/10

It has so much potential to be greater, but it feels like the developers have friends that want to throw their ideas in that are ruining the overall vision!

The intro is humorous, doesn't fit.. scrap! Why do I say this, I'm 38.. Been there since Nintendo  Mario's days. Star Craft, Diablo, Terminal Velocity, Prince of Persia on MS dos. Sim City, Everything becomes bland my days. Then this game comes out and I'm like ""wow, okay something unique! finally!""

When you get to start to arrive at the first train station hub, the music! wow!... just hits home at an epic level of grandeur! The scale of a titan built obelisk! Compelling you with the music to not give up and to move forward! The chains that are like sky scrapers in length! the sky brimming with colors and the animations are epic! I felt like I was transported to another world! That! That is what I look for in a game at my age and what  I have seen and played over so many years.

Then you get into the hub, and the ""Nazi soldiers"" have the AI of a wet noodle and the brain of a potato. The hit box is horrendous and makes you wonder why this is a plot filler and check marker? 

After a while, you get to a point where you can get these ""SUPER CUTE"" cuddly creatures that you hire and have to feed on your train. Why? Who's idea was this? The modeling and color scheme go against everything that's in the game!

It's early access, but you can tell this is a small dev team that doesn't have direction. I give it a thumbs up because it gave me the impression of something unique and I want to support that! But, they are trying to mix 3 to 4 different themes or peoples ideas into one game and that's not going to work.

I won't give criticism without positive feed back.

(Ditch the engineer / guard intro finding the scientist shack in the woods!) Feels like an after thought. When you drive the train to the station and that epic music hits, why? That music is so profound! The art style is so direct! The vision was there! Why did you take other peoples advice and add things to detract from it?
Answer: You have swords and bows of colossal scale, the imagery is breath taking like it was divined from the gods! So, why not keep it that way? What if this is a test from the gods on humanity and ""you were chosen"" to forge the path? Greek gods of old waging war and are at a stale mate? They needed a human to see if they can push the boundaries of the subconscious mind ""train"" into the multiverse of reality? Could be that the protagonist is in a coma from WW2 or WW1 which ever you want to prefer and if they have the ""will"" to navigate the mind? AKA battlefield? represented in the wreckage's and the swords and bows and arrows in the background.

The companion system should be recollections of the past, former friends and companions during the World War. That the protagonist manifests into the subconscious reality. Not these weird cute cuddly creatures. 

This way the ""Nazi's can be kept in the game as a antagonist"" that the gods use to hinder your progress to see if you can over come your coma. Is the will to live stronger than giving up in the void of the subconscious mind? The fate of the heavens is determined by your actions and the gods are watching.

Bam! epic story! flows, not weird stuff being thrown in for no reason.. the cute cuddly creatures feel like a girl friend was like I want something CUTE!!! so you added it. The Nazi's .. why? You being some random person in the woods finding some shack? weird.. doesn't flow? Why have such epic art in the world if you have conflicting story arcs! Dial it in DEVS.

To the person that made the world art! I tap my hat to you good Sir/Ma'am! You have done a fantastic job! Who ever created the music leading to the train station hubs in the void! You have moved my heart! Thank you! But, everything else, poor.. poor decisions and is being wasted! It doesn't Flow! 

It's early access so please change direction and make an okay game to an EPIC game!.. no pun intended.",1

Surprisingly didn't run into any bugs (other than maybe getting stuck for a moment on some geometry) in my 10 hours, really well done in that regard.

Gameplay-wise it's floaty/arcadey, the loop is simple yet fun, quests/missions are VERY simple.

Inventory management can be a nightmare, & Carl (an all AI) likes to get stuck, he can't fit through certain doors.

I HATE the reptilian eyes everyone has (its because the face has an indent for the eyes, and the eyes are just flat textures).

Unskippable dialog/cutscenes should be a sin in modern gaming. If you fail a mission you have to watch the entire cutscene again.

If you have played Pathfinder 2e, even if it's just the Starter Box, I am sure this would be a fun little adventure for you.
If not, this is a rather decent alternative/""pre-gaming"" before you get into Starter Box - or perhaps another tryst in Otari?
Note that this *is* based on the TRPG, so RNG will absolutely ruin you, and not having basic knowledge of how Pathfinder 2e work may be disadvantageous. I unfortunately can't erase TTRPG knowledge from my mind, so this review is coming from the angle of a TTRPG veteran.

In term of difficulty, I haven't played hard mode yet, but...
The loot is *very* generous, and the availability of the night's rest in middle of the campaign allows for rooms for mistakes for the two casters in the party.
I haven't done the math, but I assume the encounters are rather balanced. There's a few jokes that earned a chuckle from me, such as mention of the fight being literally of trivial difficulty.
If you play the game carefully, with proper usage of flanking, demoralize, raising shield, and cantrips, this is very doable blind on normal mode - perhaps even easy.
(It would be nice if there are extra shields, btw; Having an extra shield for either the cleric or rogue would make for interesting strategic choices at times, even if they aren't able to use shield block reaction - that +2 circumstantial bonus to AC is great. Sorc's fine, she's got Shield ;) )

One thing I would like to see, albeit perhaps difficult to implement, would be a small segment playing with subsystems (https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1187) as well as some hazards. But that's for later! 

Thank you for your hard work, Dawnsbury Studios. Carry on, Pathfinders.",1
0,138274245,2387660,"Do you like jumping? How about it not working when you press the button to jump?? If you answered yes to both these questions, you'll love this game! 

I want to write this to help the developer in hopefully making this game better. I wouldn't say this is a terrible game. I'd say this game is very uncomfortable. It's an awful feeling when a game has this shortcoming, because it's very hard to overcome. I'll explain specifics so it makes sense.

Before I say a bunch of negative things about this, there are a few redeeming qualities.

PROS

I really enjoy the visuals in the game. It's exactly how it looks in the trailer which I don't consider a bad thing. It has an great visual atmosphere that could be very versatile. 

The puzzle aspect of the game has a comfortable layout that was straightforward while making it something that you would solve in a series of lives, learning from each mistake. At first I thought the crystals/paths should be color coordinated, but that would take away from the immersion of the puzzles (Not that they're very difficult). 

The sound of the game wasn't bad. I normally play with music on when I'm playing so sounds aren't a big selling point unless I'm playing a game that requires sound, but I always check it out to see if it fits, and if the music is good. I'd say the visuals and soundtrack would be the major selling points.

Cons

You have platforms that fade after jumping on them. This is a classic trope in 2D gaming. The platforms, however, have no indication that this will happen, and there's platforms that look exactly the same that don't disappear. Designing something like it looking cracked or a different color would fit well with this. This wouldn't be such a big deal if your jump worked when you press it, but if you're not on solid ground (Platforms don't count as solid ground), your jump doesn't work if you're moving. This leads to you running straight into spike pits that are instant death because the basic essentials of movement in this game are flawed. 

When the color palate changes, it makes it so you can't see your health/stamina. I mean, I know I can count to 3, but this shouldn't happen. It also makes the game less detailed in general with the background blending even moreso with the foreground. This palate change seemed pointless as well, so it having negatives while not adding anything to the game was a bad decision in my opinion. I'm not discussing the ""outside"" vs what appears to be ""indoors"". I'm discussing the part that looks like it was made to play on an original Gameboy.

The control layout was weird. Using O and P instead of regular keys like space, z, x, shift made it even more uncomfortable than it needed to be. I used a controller and changed the layout with Steam button mapping, but I always try out controls on the keyboard to see if I am comfortable before switching to a controller because you always have more control with KB&M over a controller.

You unlock double jump very quickly. When you unlock double jump, you also get unlimited power to fight the boss, but that goes away and only reappears during boss fights. I really feel like the stamina should regenerate over it being 3 shots, and then it wouldn't feel so off switching from unlimited power and back to 3 shots. Also when you're at unlimited power and jump/shoot, you glitch back to the ground and your shots sometimes disappear. When you're fighting a boss that is attacking you, movement is vital, and losing attacks because you're dodging and attacking at the same time is disappointing. If this is such a big issue that it can't be corrected, I'd turn off shooting while jumping. It's already not possible to attack regularly while jumping, so it would be plausible.

Dying is annoying. I get that there should be some sort of fail sequence, but the levels are too bland to have to be replayed over and over. If jump was reliable, it wouldn't be so bad. IMO this is the biggest flaw and it effects multiple aspects of the game, hence why I keep bringing it up. There's so much unused space in the levels, just filled with jumping to platforms and over spikes. This brings me to thinking your life bar should be bigger AND spikes shouldn't be one shot kills. It's just so much dying and hoping jump works the next time.

Is there any point in the game over sections? I feel like they're just tedious rooms that you can waste your energy on. Maybe if a level makes you die to get a crystal from one, it would make more sense, but I couldn't get over the jump button being flawed to finish this to find out if that was a puzzle in this game.

The lack of diversity is something that is literally joked about in the game. Really? You shouldn't take pride in something you know is going to be a complaint. I played through 2 bosses and got over it before getting to the third. This was because I spent 10% of the time playing the game and 90% getting back to where I was because jump didn't work. During these levels, I saw a total of 3 enemies that weren't bosses. I went through multiple sections. It wasn't like there was 3 rooms, more like 20. 3 enemy types this entire time. One that stumbles toward you. One that plays a harp that does a ranged attack at you. Then the last is the worst. It's a turret, shooting ranged attacks at your direction or shooting in a straight line meant to be an obstacle... and they can't be attacked. So if they're the type that shoots in your direction and you have to make a jump when you're in their range, you're getting hit no matter what. One of the sections had this, and it made you jump twice off disappearing platforms while you're in it's range. It's at the end of the section as well, so you have to replay the entire section if you fall or got hit before because you're 100% getting hit twice by this no matter what.


I know this isn't a ""Early Access"" game, but it feels flawed to the point where it should be fixed. If jumping was fixed, I would consider finishing the game, because what I played besides the nosediving into spikes wasn't terrible. I hope there's a bit more variety in the bosses than just avoid and attack them while they're moving towards you in a pattern, but I'm unsure if that will be a thing seeing as there was only 3 enemy types in the first 3 levels of the game. I've made worse reviews for better games because I knew the game wouldn't get fixed. I hope that isn't the case for this one. If this gets worked on, I'll change my review accordingly",0

Sadly this game is just a shadow of the former Age of Wonders games. So much of the exotic and complex game play of the previous AoW games is gone. This game is just bland. The races you play and encounter are just cosmetic, no longer matter at all. The spells and magic system is just copy/pasted variations with slight changes. The biomes no longer matter. It used to be a hugely impactful thing fighting in hostile terrain with races that hated snow/swamp/desert/etc.

Even visually, for a 2023 game it's just bland. The world maps are uninspired and small compared to previous AoW games. Want to play on a large map with a small number of factions? Good luck with that. Want to play on the surface or underground only? Nope, no longer.

The combat system seems to have gotten the most amount of attention, and it's okay. But it gets slow and boring as you play a map. I end up auto-resolving almost every battle unless the AI borks it, and then I manually resolve it.

If a game developer comes across this... Please, for the love of god, add the option to raze or ""cleanse"" cities of evil factions without becoming evil myself. Really any other option other than another vassal would be nice, especially to free up that territory for your own expansion.

The Bad: AI

The AI does not really interact with one another, and in Story 5 (Normal) it's really on full display at its worst.
- Friendly AI was actively choking off my territories with outposts in just the first few turns basically turning it into a 1v7 by turn 20
- Enemy AI was attacking me on all 3 borders having just simply waltzed through Friendly territory to do so, without any conflict whatsoever
- Enemy Hostile infestations never/rarely appeared to attack Friendly or Enemy AIs, or vis versa
- In game 1, the enemy AI had a magical victory triggered around turn 65 and friendly AI walked armies up to enemy borders and just walked around which left me to have to try and solo conquer 4 factions and traverse the entire map in 15 turns... spoiler, I didn't.
- In game 2, after I stopped enemy Magical Victory by sheer dumb luck, the enemy AI sort of just stopped playing the game for 30+ turns and then when I went to cast for Magical Victory, it kept attacking 2 naked outposts for all 15 turns, only to abandon the sieges the turn before killing them...

I wish there was a neutral option, but having to choose one, I'd rather recommend it than not, which is mainly due to me seeing what it can be rather than what it currently is

First off, this game is rather early in development, there are plenty of bugs (not just the crawling kind), missing QoL features, etc, but nothing that'd make the game unplayable, although quite frustrating at times, performance isn't very optimized yet, though that's not even the biggest issue with the game imo

[b]The Good:[/b]
[list]
[*]The Graphics are great, even on lower setting the game is really pretty (as far as a desert can be) and especially at night it can be incredibly atmospheric, with all the bullets, missiles and explosions cutting through the darkness and illuminating the ground, and I love the models and designs, they feel very grounded and fitting
[*]The Sounds are a bit mixed, but overall pretty good, especially the tanks again stand out, the sound of them firing as well as just their idle sounds is straight up p*rn to your ears
[*]The Gameplay, despite the bugs and issues, is incredibly fun, especially infantry mode, it feels phenomenal even just driving alongside your teammates in formation heading towards the enemy, or firing in a phalanx, or looking up in awe at the size of the absolute unit that is the Harvester
[/list]

[b]The Bad: (major issues I see with the game long term)[/b]
[list]
[*]Since it is somewhat asymmetrical between aliens and humans, there will probably always be some balancing issues, especially if you take into account the different strats that both sides can use, and whether they do
[*]In relation to the previous point, there are some incredibly cheesy tactics for FPS players on both sides; for the aliens since they're able to climb any object, they can get on top of a cliff and shoot down at buildings, or climb on top of buildings or harvesters where it's incredibly hard for units to get them (either you have to circle them so they don't have any safe angles, or get on top of the building/harvester where again you're in melee range and quickly disposed of, additionally you dealing damage to your own buildings/units makes it hard to deal with them without damaging your own); and for the humans being able to teleport anywhere near an allied unit, together with the currently free unit pickers allowing them to infinitely teleport near an enemy base with Heavy or Commando units whittling away at the base's health as long as there are allies nearby, at no cost - though the latter is imo less cheesy and the issue here is more with the unit picker being free for infantry players, since the teleport is almost mandatory due to aliens being able to build nests in places where human units can't even get by normal means, less so vehicles, although that might somewhat be alleviated by the addition of aerial units which are currently being worked on, but all in all these strats make it very unfun for both sides, and the matches are worse now that people figured these out and exploit them to their maximum, compared to the first week where people were playing more ""normal""
[*]On a similar note, imo Scorpions are incredibly unbalanced/broken right now, I get that they're the Aliens' main ranged unit after the early-game Impalers, but it is very easy for them to rush producing these and then proceed to absolutely demolish an entire human base with just one Scorpion or two, at a point where humans have nothing to put against them really due to their high healthpool/armor, especially if paired with the previously mentioned ""cliff cheese"" strat
[*]In general, Aliens seem to dominate most games, due to not being held down by the issues that human Harvesters have, being their huge size, slow speed and on top of that atrocious pathfinding, they can just spam their gatherer units and snowball from there getting an overabundance of ressources compared to humans, the only thing holding them down really being potential unfortunate round starts with a lack of ressources nearby
[/list]

[b]The Ugly: (bugs and other minor issues that will likely be fixed)[/b]
[list]
[*]Harvesters are atrocious, particularly their pathfinding, but also the fact that sometimes they can't seem to make their way up certain hills, either due to a lack of engine power or just sliding back down again due to a lack of friction, which is especially awful since the AI doesn't realise and keeps trying, effectively getting the unit stuck until you notice - at least you can control them as a player, which alleviates these issues mostly, and is almost mandatory at times, but it's more a workaround than a permanent solution
[*]When a round restarts, as a client you're only presented with the choice of Commander/Infantry, no faction, choosing one seems to softlock you into a spectator mode, so you have to leave the match and rejoin before being able to play again
[*]With the Railgun Tank particularly (dunno if with any other units) it frequently happens that my missile barrage is homing sideways into a nearby allied building when aiming at a far away enemy even if I'm aiming nowhere near the building
[/list]

[b]Notes for the Devs:[/b]
[list]
[*]giving player-controlled units a different color on the map for infantry mode, also being able to move with the map open (used to be possible before, somehow doesn't work anymore after the latest patch), and showing player names in the unit info window when hovering over player-controlled units with your crosshair
[*]being able to adjust brightness and keybinds in the controls
[*]being able to see, and filter for, the individual ""Strategy"" gamemodes (HvH, HvA, HvAvH)
[*]removing friendly fire (I get the realistic approach, but it's really annoying in combination with aliens being able to climb on human structures or vehicles
[*]allow to Claim harvesters so you can get them to stop for boarding without having to tell your commander to stop them or waiting for them to halt at a deposit or return to the refinery

-Inventory management is horrible, most items only stack up to 10, while containers only hold 4-6 slots for storage.

-Whole game feels like its on rails (in a bad way), little to no exploration, no junction to change course, any path you can deviate from will have you going right back to the train.

-game gives you incentives to go fast but puts landmines in your way if you try to, forcing you to crawl through entire runs to keep your train intact.

-Gun customisation is bad, modules don't stack and as I said before containers only have 4-6 slots, if you plan on building a gun from scratch you will need 3 to 8 of these modules.

I'm playing on hard difficulty, and have had to restart quite a few fights a number of times until I figure them out.  There's a bit of a puzzley aspect to the combats, but it's definitely not a puzzle game.  There are multiple ways to beat these battles.  

One negative is that there are a LOT of weapons that you find as you progress, but you almost always end up just selecting the one that does the most damage.  Most of the weapons have gimmicks, like they do extra damage vs. a specific armor type, or give you a bonus to overwatch chance to hit.  But they do less damage, and are just not worth it.  The weapons really need a reboot in this game.  But, it's not a huge negative.  Use the biggest and baddest gun, improve your melee damage, and you will have a blast!

I really enjoy the exploration part of the missions too, even though they are pretty linear.  There are lots of side battles that are optional, but you really shoud do every one of them.  Lots of loot boxes to find, and autographs to get which let you select sponsor bonuses.

Oh yeah, there are also puzzles in the exploration part of the game.  So far they are not very difficult, a couple had me scratching my head for a couple minutes.  But they are all well done and again, enjoyable.

So, great game.  Not incredible long.  I'm 14 hours in, and probably almost 2/3rds of the way done.  I'm figuring 20-25 hours, depending on how many times I need to redo the later battles, that I'm assuming just get more difficult.

I did buy the game on launch day and I'm so glad I did because I feel the negative reviews where unfair and will hurt this game because of that.

Listen folks.  I don't have the most awesome gaming PC and I'm still able to run this on high graphics without any frame loss.  I've encountered 2 bugs in my 31 hours of game play.  Here are my PC specs.

Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4670K CPU @ 3.40GHz   3.40 GHz
RAM 16 GB

The campaign does lose frame-rates in the cut scenes.  The sound needs some optimizing.  But that doesn't make this game unplayable.  It's already miles ahead of Take On Mars which was released by a AAA studio.

It is strategic, but doesn't get overwhelming with how many choices you have or how many things you need to keep track of.
Each fight is a fun little puzzle because positioning matters a bit and order matters a bit and you have spells with fun movement or control abilities.
There are 12 different heroes to choose from and each has some special traits to make it unique, plus different spell schools that they find cards from.
A session is long enough that you get attached and make progress and feel like you earned your win, but not so long that you feel like you are slogging through it at the end.
A good balance of fast, fun, clever options.
It has unlocks, but not in a way that makes you stronger like some metaprogress systems. Just more options for heroes and cards, just enough to make it feel like progress over time.",1
0,138310213,669330,"As a long-time gamer, I've been wanting to try an auto-battler for some time. I saw an article out there somewhere, singing the praises of Mechabellum, and decided this one was worth a closer look, even though it will eventually be free to play and early access requires payment of actual cash money. I cannot tell you how many times I have gambled on some indie darling with tons of buzz only to be horribly disappointed. Mechabellum is one of those rare gems that gives me reason to keep trying new things.

I have always been a fan of the RTS and turn-based tactical genres, and it took me a little while to get used to not being able to actually control my units once the battle started. In this game, positioning, unit composition, and upgrading units with tech and higher levels are all important. After you make your choices, the chips fall where they may...and that is a highly addictive game loop that has kept me up well past bedtime every night since I downloaded. As the old saying goes...""easy to learn, but difficult to master."" I understand that Mechabellum is probably more of a mobile game than a PC or console game, but it is still engaging enough to hold my interest playing on PC.

Surprisingly for an early access game, the AI is quite good and you can learn a lot by skirmishing against bots. You have to ramp things up to the insane difficulty setting, but then you will be faced with opponents who use a variety of different strategies and units rather than depending on a single tried and true strategy or unit composition. Sometimes, you will be facing armies of high-powered giants, and other times, nasty swarms of highly upgraded crawlers will overwhelm everything you have got. Sometimes they come with air power, sometimes not. Sometimes you will get bombarded by artillery (screened from artillery counterattack by Mustangs) and sometimes not.

Rounds are over quickly, and then you get to respond to what you saw during combat for the next round. I like how you get more and more resources each successive round. It becomes super easy to convince yourself that bedtimes are for losers. Winners try just one more match.

A COUPLE OF QUICK SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DEVS:

It would be nice if units would return fire when fired upon. Too many times, I've watched powerful units at the end of the game get destroyed because they are firing on something that cannot fire at them (such as air on defenseless  ground) while some other dinky unit slowly wears the attackers down simply because they never return fire. All units within a certain area should sense the need to fire on active attackers versus units that cannot attack.

Another nice addition would be the ability to select between a focus on air versus ground targets. All units of a type could have one designation for all, or players could decide for each individual unit. The large flying fortress units (Overlords?) will often sit there shooting at ground targets while a couple of enemy Phoenix  aircraft blast them to pieces without ever receiving a defensive shot in return. It's a similar problem to the one I mentioned above about the need to return fire when fired upon.",1
0,138309803,669330,"Cool idea, but hefty price for something thats pretty much a game for your mobile device. Very little depth.",0
0,138308205,669330,"The art institution calculates and relegates the substantial and elaborate Mechabellum. The geometries oscillate the virtual convergence. The peculiar Mechabellum of that contour shows the manner in which the modernism of it is extracted. By the means of autobiographically emancipated Mechabellum, a reference point has been isolated indistinguishably by uncomfortable concentration. The osmotic Mechabellum presents and excavates the ironic and identical model.",1
0,138308072,669330,"Mechabellum is the ultimate game for anyone who's ever dreamed of being a commander of an army of mechs, or for anyone who's just really into giant robots blowing things up. The game takes place on the newly colonized planet of Far-Away, which, let's be real, is probably the best name for a planet ever.

As the Commander of your own mech army, you get to customize and level up your units before each battle, strategically placing them on the battlefield to crush your enemies. From the nimble Wasp light aircraft to the massive Vulcan, there are a ton of unique mechs to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

But let's be real, the best part of Mechabellum is watching your mechs destroy your enemies without mercy. It's like watching a robot version of Godzilla vs. King Kong, but instead of fighting over a city, they're fighting over Far-Away.

And if you're not ready to take on other players in PvP combat just yet, don't worry. Mechabellum has got you covered with advanced AI battles. Try different unit combinations and abilities without the pressure of facing real players. Because let's be real, there's nothing more embarrassing than losing a giant robot battle in front of other people.

Overall, Mechabellum is an epic auto-battler that's perfect for anyone who loves giant robots, blowing things up, or just wants to be the coolest Commander on the newly colonized planet of Far-Away. So grab your mechs and get ready to wreak havoc on your enemies!

And I'm delighted, too, with the new hero/race system, which seems to be really working for players who are willing to role-play a little, something the system is designed (very brilliantly, I think) to encourage.

So no, I wouldn't recommend this right now as there's way too many bugs that lead to a huge amount of downtime where the game slows to a crawl or doesn't even spawn you in, and I can't recommend that.

The actual combat is a bit janky mechanically but it does work and can be quite fun, but this is eclipsed by a range of small but very annoying issues like constantly taking fall damage from tiny drops as humans, economies never getting off the ground to make good armies, and some ping and rubber banding issues.

I want this game to do well so it can get the glow up it deserves because the scale of combat can be awesome, but right now the game very rarely gives you an opportunity to participate in the cool moment and instead you end up a small slow idiot running around a desert with very little direction or engagement.

There are side stories which made the game shine! There are a lot of AI games but none of them have as good side stories and voiced characters even the AI.  It's a beautiful game with lots of choices, an interesting setting, feedback after each chapter, and a beautiful story.  The AI has personality but it's a straight dichotomy of good or evil.  I don't know if there is a good ending but I got a bad one and got to see what happened to some of the characters.  You do both good and evil whether intentional or accidental is your choice but I heard the ending is the same.  However! You can earn achievements in the game and outside the game with a changing story based on your choices, however, I've been told that doesn't change the ending.

Surely they have learned something after making THREE whole games in the series, and start doing a little bit better. I've noticed that they focus on how quickly they can get games out rather than the quality of them, and knowing the popularity the sequel has, they might believe that if they get one out every two months it'll do a great job. Euphoric Brothers, you should start focusing on the quality of your games rather than the amount of games you can push out. Perhaps start listening to what the community has to say. When you guys ranted off to twitter about how people refund your games, just remember it's your fault for making the games under two hours.

Here are the biggest problems with this game:
- You only have access to 4 heroes at the start, each with limited abilities. If you want more, you have to complete a few runs to unlock them. This means that the first few times you play this game are going to be very repetitive.
- To make it worse, you only have a minimal selection of items and skills unlocked from the start. So in the first few runs, you will keep running into the same things over and over again. Hero skills are unlocked very slowly via map encounters, further increasing the repetitiveness of this game.
- You can unlock more items and permanent buffs with candles of hope. The issue is that you don't know what items you will unlock. If you are lucky, you will unlock a few good ones early on and then you have no reason to unlock more because you will decrease the chance of running into good items on your travels. Or you can have bad luck and keep unlocking items that you have no need for.
- The hamlet in DD1 was great; you knew exactly what you need to unlock different types of improvements. You would plan your expeditions around getting the kind of resources you need most. In here, there is no planning. You simply grind candles of hope and pray that you unlock something cool.

Once you have a fair few unlocks, the game gets quite fun. Different from DD1 and not as good but still fun. However, getting there is tedious. And you will still get stuck on bosses on occasion purely because you haven't invested enough candles into unlocks.",0
0,138311965,1940340,"Let me add a disclaimer first: I do think the game is quite decent, but it's marred by a huge issue which is what has made me decide to vote ""no"" on whether I would recommend this game to other players. 

The issue is the metagaming aspect that is expected which leads to a very poor experience for those who want to play blind, are unaware of potential sources of information and so on. 

In my opinion, Red Hook has fallen for the survivor bias, balancing the game around a subset of players who will maximize everything and will look up online every aspect of the game, small or big. This leads to a situation where if you look up things, your experience will be much smoother and pleasant than if you decide to play blind. It is expected that someone who looks up things online will have an advantage over someone who does not, but the issue is that the game is balanced around you looking things up. Self-exploration is punished fiercely. 

Some examples:

1. Class skill unlocks. Classes start with 5 skills, can unlock 6 more via 5 different Hero Shrines. You can see the name of the skill in the Crossroads, but you can't know what they do (and trusting your knowledge of the first Darkest Dungeon can be misleading). Some characters greatly benefit from certain unlocks, as the base skill set is very underwhelming (Hellion, Runway, Occultist, Vestal). Some others are quite good from the very beginning (Man-at-arms, Plague Doctor). The issue here is that you look up the skills, you can know: 1) in which order you should unlock the skills, 2) what the skills actually do, so you can know that certain skills will allow you have a much easier time against enemies X or Y, 3) where you probably can stop unlocking skills for a character and focus on a different one. 

This leads to a metaprogression that either makes the experience fairly smooth (you know what to unlock next on whom to defeat certain boss/cultists) or terrible, as you are totally unaware of what are the possibilities of a team setup. In example, the Hellion can remove her debuff, the Occultist can have a more active way to generate tokens, you can have multiple ways of removing/stealing enemy positive tokens and so on. 

The solution would be to show a preview of the skill in the Crossroads. 

2. Misleading/confusing text. The explanations of some trinkets, items or skills can be hard to understand. When is a certain skill activated? Does the initial criteria only apply to the first part of the skill or also the second? Why do I need to go back and forth when picking a character path to check how skills have changed? In example, it can be easy to miss that the Flagellant's Exanimate turns Punish into a R1-2 skill. In order for me to have an easier time picking a path, I need to rely on external sources. Skill, item mechanics? Got to look it up as well because it's better explained in wiki or in the official Discord. Proper information and improvements to the interface would help here. 

3. Counterintuitive enemy mechanics, lack of in-game information. You can bring up additional information about the enemy while in combat, which I think is very positive...but it's lacking vital information. You can't hover to actually understand how something works. You can either wipe or have your run ruined because you didn't understand a mechanic...or just look it up online and realize how your party composition was doomed from the start. This is especially bad when it comes to act bosses. Once again, you can easily overcome the boss if you look up online the strategy. You didn't? Well, that's 1.5-3 hours wasted (depending on Confession and so on) and you may not even understand what went wrong. The in-game tool should provide a lot more information than it does. 

4. Team compositions. Team composition (+path) is the biggest macro decision you will make in the entire game (and you do it a few seconds into a run). The abundance of dots by the enemies, the abundance of buff tokens (prot, dodge) and the lasting effects of stress (due to relationships) will push you into a certain team composition. While this was no different in DD1, you could at least play around different team compositions to adapt to each zone, especially if it was turn for a boss fight. Not here, as your team must be able to handle all the random encounters, at least one lair boss and then, the act boss. This limits your options and, once again, pushes you to a few meta compositions. Do or die. 

The game should reward optimization, learning, expertise. But the issue is, that from almost the beginning (act 2), you may start being punished by non-optimized choices that you made blindly. You like the Graverobber, so you upgraded her and unlocked her skills? Well, she's rather bland and there are much stronger options. You've now wasted your time and become frustrated on the way. The game should provide more information to reward the exploratory aspect of the game, instead of providing inane information.

Red Hook has balanced the game with the mentality that people will look up things online anyways. But that's where the flaw in the thinking is: people look up things online because otherwise the experience is too frustrating. 

DD1 is a masterpiece, but it had a rough start as well. I'm sure that, with time, DD2 will become a masterpiece as well. But it's not there yet. As a bottom note, I am not complaining about the difficulty of the game itself, but the lack of information that is pushing me to either look up things online or become frustrated. How things work should be very straightforward. Skills, mechanics, items, everything. And people should be able to understand what the characters are capable of in the long run.

0,138311842,1940340,"As of writing I've finished the first major chapter boss and put in more than enough runs to understand the core loop and how drastically it differs from its predecessor. Definitely enough to at least write a hot take down with some info on how you'll like this game depending on your expectations.

DD2 is not a game that's trying to put itself above its counterpart, more aiming to stand alongside it and provide a similar game feel for a different type of player.

I love DD1's combat and aesthetic, but the one thing that kept me from really sinking hard into it was the demand for grind and the possibility that all of that time spent grinding could shatter to pieces in a matter of moments. The thought of losing a team built up over 40 hours because of bad dice rolls or a few mistakes snowballing was always way too tall of an ask for me. If you're like me in this aspect, I highly recommend trying out DD2.

The aesthetic has never been better. Dingy cities and ruins, windy wilds, Hellish nightmares rising up to smash down every hope you have of making it to that God forsaken mountain at the end of a chapter's journey. The new 2.5D take on the character designs look great in motion, animations feel good and crits especially are damn satisfying. The carriage isn't much fun to control, but watching your horses whip down that track and pass by ruination hasn't gotten old for me yet and likely won't.

The combat is as good as DD1's, if not better. It still feels tense, every fight can turn into a desperate scrape and a bad turn can quickly escalate into a dire situation you're lucky to crawl out the other side of. Decisions each turn still matter a lot, with what feels like that patented Darkest Dungeon RNG showered on to make encounters swinging in each side's favor at the drop of a hat. A resolute stress test at the right time can save a whole fight, just as a meltdown can destroy it. My only real gripe with the combat thus far is I find certain enemies being able to go into a Death's Door state rather than dying outright to be rather annoying. If I earn a kill I should keep the kill, it feels a little overly punishing. Bad rolls can eat an entire turn just trying to confirm a kill, and a turn means a lot in basically any encounter. I also dislike that status ailment kills no longer automatically clear corpses, but I've also never liked the corpse mechanic in general. To be fair corpses are slightly more balanced now since your party members also gain corpses and can be attacked by the AI.

Team compositions are fun to play with and involve far less risk of your time to encourage experimentation. Example being the comp I cleared the first chapter with involved a Vestal (typically a backline healer) taking the front of party because of a quirk that made her jump to the front at the start of each combat with some benefits to even it out. Pair that with a Hellion who can move forward on first turn, and a Highwayman's Duelist Advance and suddenly I had a beefy frontline with my Vestal firing off charged spells thanks to her passive. With time investments to experiment being so much smaller it really feels like I have the freedom to try whatever I want, and the backstory missions each character can participate in are further incentive to give everyone a shot and see what skills are up their sleeves. The relationship system also adds a new twist to teams which I find fun, teammates getting so hostile with one another that they'll literally stab them in the back after attacks has created a few nail biting encounters for me in just the bit I've played and positive relationships confer tangible benefits that can make a huge difference in combat.

The structure around the combat is the biggest difference between the first game. Progress is more like a traditional rouguelite, with a currency to give you permanent unlocks and trinkets are items found during runs instead of stored at a hub area. Personally, I think this is really great. The unlocks you can get through the progression currency typically just give you more options instead of making you outright stronger. Most unlocks for characters give them slightly higher resistance to being killed at Death's Door, but that's really only giving you a small chance at another turn to scrape a solution together. Excess characters are also randomly added to your party at checkpoints if you suffer a death but not a party wipe, but with how fast a character can be killed this feels more like throwing the player a bone. It's never guaranteed to work out just because you're able to throw a lot of characters at it and inn checkpoints are far between. Other unlocks can help you avoid a few fights at maximum, which is big but hardly game breaking. 

All in all I feel the structure lends to a smoother, more fun and less frustrating gameplay loop. Losses still happen often and feel punishing, but not overly so like the first game where it could feel daunting to get back up on the horse. You could likely make an argument that the new structure is too streamlined or watered down, and I personally don't agree. I just think it's different and you're either in for it or you're not. If you're not the first game is still there and has tons of community content to keep it alive forever. I can say for damn sure that if this was Darkest Dungeon 2 in the more traditional expectation of a sequel then I likely wouldn't have even given it a shot let alone liked it as much as I do. This is a game I will see to the end, and I would never say that about its predecessor.",1

0,138310634,1730250,"[b]Tl;dr:[/b] You should get Pan'orama if you like casual city-builder games that favor strategic elements to a significant degree.

Pan'orama is a good chill, casual city-builder game that I mostly enjoyed, but there certainly are parts of it that can be improved.

First of all, I found the strategic aspect of the game ahead of its casual aspect. [b]Pan'orama requires more focus on strategy, especially during the first few minutes of each run, rather than just putting grids in places and having a casual experience.[/b]

A problem I had with the game is that [b]each run takes too long, over two hours[/b] in my experience, to complete. After some point during my runs, I was desperately placing grids randomly to finish the game, without having fun at all but just for the sake of finishing it.

The juice elements of the game are of great amount. Taking various actions in the game has feedback no matter what the action is, and it certainly feels good.

There is an option to hide the user interface to take photos, and there is even a [b]sandbox mode[/b] where you can create nice scenery. Although that is the case, [b]there aren't any visual filters or environmental effects[/b] to enhance the visuals during the run or photo-taking phase.

When it comes to the graphics, everything looks great, and there is a great variety of tiles, but there aren't any graphics settings in the game for more.

When it comes to the audio, it's not the strongest point of the game. I especially found the main menu music pretty irrelevant, but in-game sound effects add value to the feedback of actions at a good rate.

Overall, Pan'orama is a cute game that I enjoyed playing. With the upcoming updates, I hope the developers turn it into a more pleasing game considering the casual experiences.",1
0,138312433,1159690,It's a lot of fun and surprises me throughout the progression curve. I especially like building up the train components and [spoiler]taking care of the little rofleemos[/spoiler].,1
0,138311197,1159690,"I don't know why some people have a problem with this game, we are around 10 hours in and just unlocked the Winch and that added so much more content on the exploration side, no longer are you completely bound to your train you can explore and find different things in the void

while I do agree that the game is a bit grindy I would say that it's just like any similar games like Raft

what balances the grind is that many things don't have durability (so you don't have to constantly repair it) and the food system isn't aggressive at all, in fact you're not forced to eat 

while some parts are repetitive (like the research) there are always other things that a player can do that brings progress (like building stuff, collecting resources, fight at stations or (when you unlock the winch) exploring the void)

the only thing that is actually not so nice about the game (in my opinion) are the bugs, there are not many bugs, but when you encounter one it's most likely more than a visual bug, BUT when you go onto the discord server of this game and send a bug report there (at least in our case) we got a direct response from one of the developers asking for the save file and offering a workaround until the bug is fixed

the game has bugs yes, but it isn't a finished game yet and the devs do actually fix bugs

as an end note I would also like to mention that the game is made with a lot of love and many of the animations are really lovely and just add a nice feeling to the game (there is a chance to have different reloading animations than the standard one) stuff like that is not necessary in a game but it's nice to have and shows that the devs put love into the game (which is greatly appreciated)",1

Likes:
- The visual effect was really cool and the concept of being a blind fight was really unique. I found myself really looking into the background, the set, and the characters to capture every detail I could
- Background music was top tier and I loved the voice acted lines. It brought the story to life
- Combo counter was fun and made it exciting to hit the finisher
- Multiple evade/counter options for combat was a good touch. Made it more exciting than just spamming combat buttons

Improvements:
- I wish there were a few different finishing moves (maybe 2-3?). Because the finisher also increased the combo counter, I felt that I was continuously spamming the finisher and just seeing the same thing every time. 
- Camera movement was tough. I tried to adjust sensitivity but it always felt too sensitive while also not sensitive enough. It was hard to control during game play as well. 
- It would be nice to have some ring or indicator of which enemy you're hitting. Sometimes my character practically teleported to the other side of the fighting area to fit an enemy and I didn't get why.

0,138313984,1159690,"For a short explanation, yes this game is a lot like raft and others in that same vain. Most of you're time will be spent collecting materials and making upgrades. If that not your thing, avoid this.

[*]Game play - Collect and craft
[*]Visuals - Stylized and pretty
[*]Music - Relaxing outside of combat
[*]Story - Meh, it's there
[*]Combat - kinda floaty but also supper meaty so it feel impactful
[/list]

However, if you are the type of person that likes this stuff then this game is amazing. Upgrades feel like large leaps in progression and in the 20ish hours iv'e played I have really liked watching my train expand and laying everything out how I like it. The train becomes this one safe place you are almost always attached to, protected from the rest of the void. Gathering resources can be tedious at first but once you get the grappling hook you realize you can set your train to full speed and grab anything that passes by without stopping, this method has given me more materials than I can use.

In terms of progression outside of the train, this game has continued to surprise me. The game continues to throw new activities at you from your depot stops to eventually enemy trains pulling up and raiding you and a round based horde mode to get more resources. These activities can definitely turn into a checklist of things to do when they come up but for me it's enough of a distraction from collecting stuff and most of the encounters can either be ignored or have multiple ways to deal with them. You definitely want to go at your own pace and enjoy the ride. There is a story but it ends up taking more of a backseat.

I've only been playing solo but I know that in order to play with friends you need to link your epic account witch can be frustrating but I think people are making it a bigger problem then it actually is. Lots of other bigger titles do the same thing, RB6S requires a Ubisoft account, it's not a huge deal.",1

The idea of it is amazing and to an extent quite novel.
The execution kind of a letdown.
Scroll to the bottom for a TL;DR and conclusion.

Note: My experience was entirely in co-op and as such might diverge if you're going to play singleplayer.

Let's start with the bad:
- Despite an asking price of about 30 EUR, the Early Access release was riddled with massive bugs in the beginning.
- The story, while funny and interesting, leaves much to be desired so far. We'll see how this goes with the next chapters.
- As another point, the supposed first chapter that the Early Access release ships by seems very.. shallow, it is more of a prologue.
- There is nearly no reason to ever speed up the train. Going any faster than slow will, damage the player if gathering behind objects, consume fuel and water, make players potentially miss out on materials and other things, destroy the engine if entering a minefield and more. There's no upside aside for the chases, but those aren't difficult to defend from.
- There are a lot of networking hiccups.
- Questionable decisions in terms of UI and UX
The neutral:
= As a rail fan, some parts of the train are really.. off: The rails are very short, with cuts just after a tie, instead of being joined together at the tie. The steam engine has no real connection to the wheels. There's a display of steam pressure and boiler temperature, yet those don't seem to really.. do anything? I certainly should not expect simulator-level of accuracy, but attention to detail would show a lot of care for a title like this.
The good:
++ The developers tackled the messy release very well, delivering three hotfixes in the release week, fixing the worst issues including save bugs, progress hangs, malware-like behavior (dont ever open a browser window without user input!). And so far they seem to be keen to improve this game for the better.
+ The actual game, disregarding balance issues, is actually fun.
+ Story is interesting and comedic, narrator as part of it is comedic too, and the voice is also comfortable.
+ The mechanics around gunplay are relatively great for the type of game it is. There are issues (especially networking) but the base that is there is very good.
+ The music score is great, personally reminds me somewhat of Breathedge and Starbound. There are also musical cues for incoming dangers - needs more variety but already very good.

TL;DR - good game, has issues. Steam release, despite Early access on another platform for >1year, was botched, [b]but[/b] developers delivered quality fixes [b]fast[/b]. Yet, ~30 EUR not exactly worth the current state and content.

If you can afford it and the game speaks to you - try it and see for yourself. Otherwise, hang on, but check again at a later point.

Personally I will look forward to play again once Chapter 2 comes out, purely by the fact on how the devs handled the release, and will update this review by then.",0

Guns can also be customized and have more options then farcry 5, with a larger variety and not relying on tied systems. Most items are found in stash boxes peppered around the map, and helping out people usually gives you a few markers  to go check out. Loot from the boxes does appear to be randomized if it is a clothing piece but static if it is a gun. Named special guns also exist that have static parts to them that cant be customized but are strong or have a gimmick to them, and it unlocks the skin for the normal variant. 
Cars and transport can also be customized to some extent, but shop cars may have static models. Perks are also no longer there and replaced with equipment, with EXP being replaced by faction rep that allows for more unlocks to be crafted. You also start off with 4 gun slots, one dedicated to sidearms. 

Be aware- the cash shop in the store has a lot of items and uses two different currencies tied to Ubisoft  the first one is farcry credits and its used for the majority of the cosmetics, but each one does effect stats and guns can have effects or mods attached to them that you either can not get at all or at least early on. for the most part every gun is a skin of sorts, but a few of them are using custom models. 
The DLC packs that you can get (mostly for 10 dollars) are themed: Farcry 5, stranger things, Rambo, old west, fire fighters, red dead (or old west), splinter cell, payday, braking bad, alien, killing floor, cyberpunk, counter strike, daft punk, 007 or hit man, watch dogs, rainbow 6, and assassins creed among a few other historical ones or like a taco truck and fast food worker. I am not sure how they where not sued for some of the promos, but they are JUST different enough to get thought copyright. All the packs provide clothing and many do have effects. some have guns and/or a vehicle you can also buy the parts of the pack separately. The farcry connect uses a different currency, I think from achievements, to purchases ""exclusive"" content, mostly reused assets from other games they own. the starter pack that is on steam as a DLC comes with enough in-game currency to get one bundle and a number of smaller things, and I encroach using that over the ubisoft store directly, or not buying it at all (but it does come with exclusive stuff to steam)

The original soundtrack enhances the game's atmosphere, creating a relaxing country vibe that suits the game's theme perfectly. The horse riding mechanics are especially impressive, with the characters leaning forward and back depending on the terrain, adding an extra layer of realism to the game.

0,138315623,1294810,"This is not a great game. 

Even if everything worked, I would have difficulty calling [i]Redfall[/i] a good game.

But I wanted to give it a thumbs up anyway. Partially because I find the hate bandwagon surrounding this game distasteful. I loathe the hyperbole in the negative reviews. I've played worse. A lot worse. I played [i]Fallout 76[/i] on release. 

[i]Redfall[/i] is not a terrible game. It is... aggressively mediocre.

[i]Redfall[/i] does not feel or play like an Arkane game. It is painful to reconcile that this came from the studio that gave us [i]Dishonored, Prey[/i] and [i]Deathloop[/i]. But it [i]does[/i] feel like a Bethesda game. It feels appropriate for a studio trying to pick itself up after the trainwreck (of a train carrying dumpsters, all of which were on fire) that was [i]Fallout 76[/i] and deliver something that's not half-bad.

The open world is well-made. The island of Redfall is fun to explore and have firefights in. The graphics are usually solid, with some occasional greatness. The characters are conceptually unique and fun.

Sadly, the story could be a lot better. I found myself daydreaming of better stories for the game. Worse, the lore is dull. The bits that aren't related to the vampire apocalypse don't flesh out the world in any interesting way. The bits that are about the ongoing horror rarely provoke empathy and never offer intrigue. 

An example of a particularly bad offender is one of the first notes you find: ""Fear"". The note is a father saying how his wife and baby are staying behind in a shipping crate while he goes out for supplies. He asks how so many normally good people could become cultists for monsters, and tells us the answer is fear. The note isn't written to anyone in particular and has no reason to have been written at all. The father isn't asking for help or pleading for his family or railing at the enemy. There is no quest attached, no exploration it points to. The note is in the cargo container it talks about, and everyone is there dead (except the devs aren't going to show us a dead baby). Worse, the note points out something bizarre, something [i]mysterious[/i], and then tells us there isn't a mystery here and the explanation is as banal and cursory as possible. It reads like the devs telling us not to bother looking beyond the surface level for narrative content.

Still, I had a lot of fun running around the world with my best friend, shooting vampires and cultists as we set up safehouses and stalked the vampire ""gods"" that rule the island.

And there were moments of brilliance. I won't spoil with an example as they are few and precious. But those moments told me the kind of game this could have been. And should have been.

I would have given this a thumbs up despite so many lackluster elements, but the game has bugs and issues that just started to sap the fun I had found in it. 

Monsters scale to your level, so those bigger damage numbers never feel meaningful. To the contrary, I find myself avoiding combat because I didn't want to level. Leveling just meant that the guns I found which I liked would lose their effectiveness. Sure, it meant I also got skill points, but that brings us to other problems.

The characters are not well balanced. And even when their powers work right, some of them are too situational or limited to be desirable. While Devinder's teleporter is beyond amazing, Layla's elevator is clunky to use and drastically less versatile. And I seriously question the mindset of the devs who decided that a powerful female character's ultimate power should be having a man come and save her. Honestly, that feels gross.

I mostly played Jacob, whose power set seemed custom-made for me. Except of his powers, only the invisibility cloak worked properly. The scouting raven was a crapshoot at best who would regularly fail to notice enemies I could directly see and whose damaging ability procced once in a blue moon. Likewise, by the time we reached Burial Point, the ""powerful"" headshots that his ultimate was supposed to supply regularly did almost no damage. The ultimate became a liability, locking me out of using effective weapons whenever the spectral sniper rifle decided it wanted to be a nerf gun. Beyond invisibility, Jacob's best and most reliable ability was the special skill of carrying more lockpicks and rewire kits. And even that had an issue: when starting or joining a game, any ammo or supplies carried above the amount allowed without skills would often be lost as the game applied your skills after loading your inventory.

My best friend and I will likely finish the game together. I have no desire to continue to play solo. Nor will I return to it after we finish. 

The game is not worth full price, but I can still recommend it on deep discount if you have someone to play it with. Just don't expect an Arkane game. Expect a fairly fun if generic looter-shooter with a vampire theme.",0

Like most DD1 fans, I was expecting a similar game with new mechanics and challenges that built upon the original idea. Obviously, I was disappointed. DD2 is not like its predecessor. Instead, the game is a watered down rogue-like with classical 3 stage combat. Win or fail, the proceedings then reset with the player dumping points into the meta game. Rinse and repeat until meta game is maxed. Then you win. You don't actually have to survive, or learn, or play smart or strive to be better. Just collect candles to max out your meta game boosts, and then win.

I am a fan of rouge-likes when they are done correctly. However, in my personal opinion, this is not one of them. Which truly is a shame.

However, since I paid money for this game, I will not let this go to waste. In order to make it interesting (and something I recommend to other DD1 fans), I will impose my own restrictions.

0,138315643,758690,"I feel I've played this long enough to give it a decent review. So far, I like what I see. A space sim/survival game (essentially, your playing your own version of the movie ""The Martian""). I see a lot of potential here. It will just require patience to see it fully realised.

It reminds me of playing Subnautica during early access. Same idea with using the in game comment feature to point out bugs, quirks, logic holes as well as making suggestions on what could make the game better. If you like being in on the development of a game, and the idea of building a Martian colony appeals to you, then I definitely recommend this game.

To answer some of the negative review points. First, ""It's full of bugs."" Well duh! It's EARLY ACCESS! That's what you buy into when you purchase an early access game. If you have no interest in helping the Dev's build the game, then don't buy it. Quit posting pointless negative reviews about stuff that is common to any early access game.

""The controls are ganky"". To be fair, I thought this was a valid point for the first few minutes in game. But then I went into the settings and lowered the mouse sensitivity. Problem solved. Controls are just fine now.

Other than that, it's quite fun. The Tech tree makes sense, you can scrap/salvage materials in derelict buildings, and building your own stuff is straight forward. The only thing I've had a gripe about so far is the escape pod emergency supplies. An escape pod should be stocked with not just food, but water as well. Kind of a basic survival requirement. Also, the pod should have a port to recharge your suit. Again, another basic requirement.

One last thing. They need to adjust the gravity. Currently in game, the gravity is too close to Earth normal. Martian gravity is 0.375 of Earth normal. So your strides should be more bouncy, and WAY longer than they are now. Your jump height should also significantly exceed normal Earth jumps. You should also not lose stamina when running as quickly as you do in the game now, since less gravity means less effort on your part.

On the whole, though, I like what I see so far. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game progresses as it goes forward.",1

Gunplay is pretty nice, though.",0
0,138316281,2369390,"TLDR; DO NOT buy this game unless it is on sale. It is MAYBE worth $15. Do not buy the DLC, do not buy the extra garbage skins. This is some of the most garbage writing I've ever seen in a video game. 90% of every action that every character takes in this game, makes literally zero sense. Also, CO-OP only saves the host's progress. So the second player has to go and play everything again on their own to unlock certain aspects of the game, like the wingsuit or double barrel shotgun. This is positively infuriating if you only plan on playing this with friends, as it just seems beyond boring to play by myself.

The progression of the relationships between yourself and other primary characters happens far too quickly. My head canon for virtually every single cut-scene in this game to make any degree of sense is that some equivalent of the CIA was conducting experiments in the 1700s or something. They gathered every single person on the planet with a sub 20 IQ and dumped them on this island. Then they began intravenously injecting them with lead paint. The characters in this game a result of that experiment. Its like the devs couldn't decide between wanting to make some dark gritty revolutionary story line or just be borderlands. So they tried to do both, and it just feels jarring. 

The gameplay could still conceivably carry this game but it just feels too shallow. There are so many constant tiny little nitpicks that add up and constantly break immersion. The worse of which for me personally is probably the weapons. You can tell that the devs who handled the art for the weapons have never been close to one in their lives. They sound weak, they lack any real meaty punch when hitting enemies, and none of their mechanical aspects sound very crisp. Audio design can also carry so much weight when it comes to immersion, and they have completely missed the mark on this. One of my biggest personal pet peeves is how every single round already has the primer dented, as if it were struck with the firing pin. You can see it on any of the belt fed weapons, as well as the revolver. 

Think for a second. You are meant to be a guerrilla force, fighting a state. You should be constantly stealing enemy weapons, fighting a war of attrition against a state who has more expenses than your small band. You should be damaging their logistics, ambushing enemies, creating stockpiles. None of what you do in this game feels visceral. You don't feel like anything your doing is having any effect on the overall war; despite being essentially a one man army. For some reason, we actively take over enemy checkpoints and bases. Despite them still freely roaming the country side with heavy hardware. It doesn't feel like you're participating in guerrilla warfare, its just the same cookie cutter formula but with guerrilla paint slapped over the top of it.

When I think of a Ubisoft game, I think generic. That's what this game is, generic. Its just more formulaic Ubisoft.

I'll link below one of the scenes that really took my out of the game. [b][u] It contains spoilers, watch at your own risk. [/u][/b] So many of the characters make so many absolutely mind boggling decisions on both sides that it just makes it impossibly difficult to maintain my suspension of disbelief. Particularly when you know that the characters on your side are meant to be legendary guerrillas.

I wish I actually got to feel like we were waging a guerrilla war against a superior opponent. A war where we needed to wear down the enemies resources and force them into engagements where we had the advantage despite both numerical and technological inferiority. I wish we got to damage enemy logistics and render terrain impassable to limit their ability to move supplies around the island and support their front lines. I will definitely continue this with my friend, just to see how the story turns out. But I already know that the best ending [joke ending] was the ending [spoiler] where we got on the boat at the beginning of the game and never looked back. [/spoiler]",0

0,138316005,2369390,"Short and sweet review:

The Good: 
- Basically take Far Cry's mechanics and mix them with Just Cause's story and a scaled-back version of destruction/chaos. It's not a game mechanic, but it's definitely got that vibe to it. 
- Tight, responsive gunplay.
- Animal companions are fun and useful - you don't feel like you're babysitting them. 
- Characters are well-written. 
- Voice acting is nicely done.
- It's pretty. 

The Bad:
- They've gotten rid of skill trees/player progression in favor of equipping clothing with certain perks. 
- Looting animals and hunting for items to upgrade your weapons and gear is pared down nearly to non-existence in the form of a workbench.
- Ubisoft's required launcher is an unnecessary dumpster fire.
- Get ready for a long wait when you load it up the first time while it pre-cooks every asset known to man. 
- You can't aim the fecking Supremo. 
- Enemy AI is basically swarm you until you drop out of sight, at which point more than half of them walk backwards towards your general area so you can stealth kill them. 

TL;DR:

The mechanics are mostly well implemented, but i think it goes overboard with cooldowns, 5 turn cooldowns in a game with missions that can last as little as 1-3 turns. Enemies are good except that sniper one, it just randomly one shots your guys even behind high cover if you dont deal with them immediately, feels great.

The teammates kind of suck, half of them are introduced as the game is ending and why would you not use, the main character that is obviously the most op, the sniper you definitely need to deal with the one shooting sniper enemies before they get to shoot and the npc with the mimic beacon that can disable enemies and get them to shoot something else while you get in range ? You can only use 3 for most of the game, and those are the 3 you are going to use, the others are kind of redundant. I would have preffered for arenas to get bigger and let you use all the characters in every mission after they join.

The game runs pretty well with the exception of some animation and camera bugs and one horrendous bug  that ruins one of the end game cutscenes that i cant believe they havent fixed yet, even the youtube videos i checked had to skip that cutscene because of the bug.",1
0,138317937,1669000,"I can't believe I'm writing a bad review about this game, but here I go.

I have been playing the last mission, Grexolis, for two straight days. It's freaking absurd. The randomness in the game is good in general, until you play the last mission. You have unbreakable allies who do nothing apart of blocking your cities so you can't expand properly, stealing from you the little resources you can have. 

Did I talk about the enemy? An awesome AI which starts with maxed capital cities and resources (or cheats) to deploy an entire army for each single unit you're able to recruit. This happens in general in every map, but in this one is specially tedious because between the map settings and enemy buffs, even their support units can oneshot your units in one turn with ease. 

The first time I played this, a vassal city with his race and bufs spawned just in front of my city, and deployed 3 armies full of T3 units able to oneshot my T1. Oh, I was barely able to deploy 1 T1 army. The only reason you can win is because the AI is specially stupid and will not play as agressive as it should. Otherwise you would be razed by turn 10. Knowing this, you can attempt to cheese it until one of the 4 enemies decide to deploy magic victory by turn 60. Did I mention you have only 15 turns to stop them, while in that stupidly designed map you need like 30/50 turns to go from one corner to the other? If you're lucky enough to be near of that enemy when he decides to deploy magic victory, you can send your 3 T3-T4 units in time, and you will find yourself surrounded by 9 T5 armies with units oneshotting not only your units, but your very heroes.

It's obvious this quest battles and victory conditions haven't been tested properly, and it's frustrating. It's a great game overall, and I would recommend it as soon as this is fixed. Meanwhile, however, I can't recommend anyone to get involved. Right now it's an open beta. There are some bugs (like sieges bonus coming against the player if the defender attacks him). but nothing game breaking apart of this design. You can't give 15 turns to stop an enemy which is 40 turns from you. 

I hope the devs spend more time playing the game next time. This could have been easily avoided. I will have to cheese the map or play it until I am lucky enough to have all the odds in my favour. Knowing myself, I won't stop until I achieve this, and I hate it won't be because of skill or mental agility, but out of luck and cheesing. This is frustrating and has broken my experience.",0

0,138318630,1940340,"[b] This is a review ON THIS GAME and not a comparison with Darkest Dungeon, take it as it is [/b]
I've played this game for around 50 hours now. I'm a big fan of turn based games and turn based rpgs since I was a kid (no I don't have other turn based games on Steam because Nintendo DS and other platforms are not related to steam so chill about it), and I have to say, this game is entertaining for me and frustrating at the same time. I really love when a turn based game makes its own take on the turn based gameplay, creating or modifying some mechanics, and the main core gameplay of the turn based part of Darkest Dungeon 2 does not do anything particular to change the classic formula, it consists of: Every Round lets a character act once, you have your four characters and the enemy has one to four characters as well. The order is decided depending on the [i] speed [/i] of every character (needless to say, the one with the highest speed go first and so on). The particular take it uses is the [b] rank [/b] system, which is still implemented in some measure in basically every turn based game that makes you use more characters at the same time, the difference is that here it is a little bit more important than it is in [b] most [/b] of the others.

Now, in short, it means that the mechanics around turn based combat are solid and work well, but don't bring [b] too many [/b] new elements on the table, and it still is a pretty slow paced game, even for a turn based game, most of the time. These are all elements that can be good or bad depending on your preferences, and I don't mind them.
The artstyle of this game is [b] incredible [/b] in my opinion. I love how it communicates efficiently the mood of the world in which you play, both on the visual and audio effects, with its music being epic but never over the top, always keeping its gloom and the designs being absolutely on point with every character, both the heroes and the enemies.

The Stagecoach. I actually enjoy the Stagecoach and what brings to the table, both its passive buffs and debuffs, and the mood it brings to the journey, it really feels like a fantasy adventure with a party of heroes traveling towards the enemies and the encounters also add to that beautifully. There are some things about encounters that I don't enjoy sometimes, but I will cover it soon. I like the fact that traps and other things can break your Stagecoach, and force you into an ambush, even if it's a bit frustrating, because it's exactly how it should feel, and usually do not result in a game over in such encounters anyway, it feels like a setback and an inconvenience, exactly what it should be.

What I liked and didn't like about encounters (not fights, encounters on the road): I really liked how the choices you make directly influence your strategies, with resources you can give to people in exchange for other things, or simply to make characters bond when they have a similar opinion on something. What I didn't like it's how sometimes relationships can get out of control and backfire pretty hard, most of the times a single [i] meltdown [/i] can ruin a character's relationships with everyone to the point everyone starts to build a bad relationship with him and he can get different skills debuffed for one single mistake. This is a really challenging game, but sometimes, some things are out of your control and it can quite literally ruin a run for you. Relationships, like in real life, can snowball out of control, either in a good or bad way, sometimes. From what I've seen, if a character hates another, they will likely not take well some things that they would ignore if they were friends, and that will make things worst, to the point they will eventually and quite literally stab each other in the back during fights sometimes. Truth be told, you can learn to manage relationships through items and sometimes trading some party advantages to try and make things right, but yes, it can be quite annoying when you find in a boss fight that quite literally breathes and fills up your party's stress, and a couple meltdowns occur, and now everyone hates those two heroes. Relationships can also snowball in a good way, making friends and being hopeful or trustful towards each other can make heroes even fall in love with each other and create even some combos of sorts, buffing each other in pretty strong ways, which is always great.

Now to the farming part: [b] you can farm stuff in this game, and it's not a bad thing [/b], farming heroes is literally ""instantaneous"" and by that I mean that after my very first run I unlocked almost every hero and started trying them all out. The game itself tells you you are not expected to win on your first run and Darkest Dungeon 2 is a game of struggle and trying and trying again, and it does reward you for completing runs even more than once, making you lock some good quirks for your heroes so that they become ""permanently"" (because these bonuses last until they die in mission) stronger. In short: I don't mind the fact that I need to farm a little to unlock things, it's not boring, nor repetitive in my view, not more than any other turn based game at least.

[h1] So, my opinion about Darkest Dungeon 2 as a stand alone game is: [/h1]
I really enjoy playing it, it is one of my top 5 favourite turn based games, one of my favourite dark fantasy games of all time and I really recommend it, especially for those who are looking for a challenging game, since it's really punishing and even some little mistakes can make a big difference in a run. The designs are [b] incredible [/b] and succeed impeccably in expressing the world around you and its mood, both in visual and sound effects. The game is [b] difficult and pretty demanding for someone's brain [/b], which means it will keep your brain busy if you are trying some more advanced runs or are not being perfect, or you're simply pretty unlucky in that run, it can happen. There's a lot to keep in check, from relationships between characters, each character's stats, their build, items, trinkets, illnesses, buffs and debuffs both in and out of combat, which is a lot but you can get the hang of it after some time. The way it implements relationships between characters, the way it narrates their stories and how it implements the element of having actual characters and not just pawns to move is beautiful, and I wish it was present in more games like this one. Last but not least, you can unlock buffs, heroes, trinkets, items, stagecoach items, inn items and many other things through farming, and it's okay, it's not expensive if you manage to win your expeditions or end them a bit later instead of quitting early. 

I intentionally avoided comparing this game to its predecessor, because it has some changes, mainly in form, but in my opinion, the soul of the game is still the same, and all I am hoping to see from the first game are some characters that didn't make it to this game. People should accept that games change and evolve, and a game should be reviewed for its own qualities and flaws, not for what makes it different from its predecessor, after all, if it didn't change anything, it would've been criticized for being just a reskin.",1

0,138317934,1940340,"Preface that I have played the first Darkest Dungeon and quite enjoyed it.

This game shifts from the city building and roster management aspects of the first game as mentioned in other reviews. However, if you give the game a proper go instead of just shidding and pissing because the devs made changes you'll actually find a really enjoyable experience that's more geared towards longer term replayability than the first game IMO. While you don't get to keep your characters and gear in the same sense as the first game, you can carry them on in a basic form with upgrades each time they beat the final bosses. Additionally, each run (whether successful or not) is able to contribute to the development and betterment of your future characters and runs. Sound design is en pointe as always (I will wake up screaming at 3am with the stress damage sound looping in my head) and the game looks stunning. One of the other reviews I read gave me a piece of advice which I will pass on. Focus on character relationships. They're a very crucial aspect of the game that is easy to overlook and once you understand that time and care is needed at each inn to focus on relationships you will start to get much more rewarding runs with great team synergy.

As is the case with the first game the experience is mostly an experience in self torture and Murphy's law. But I'm addicted and can't wait to get back into it.",1
0,138317884,1940340,"First of all this game is a very different beast than Darkest Dungeon. It takes away a ton of what made Darkest Dungeon so good. Just be aware of that!

The presentation has gotten the most noticeable upgrade. The art style, animation, and music and voice acting is good.  Combat also functions decently well still, but there's very little new in terms of classes or skills. There's less management and freedom in choosing missions, gear, and difficulty. This makes the game less enjoyable for me. In Darkest Dungeon you could after a failed expedition try to build yourself up a new team doing easier expeditions. But there's less grace for that here.

One of the worst aspects is having a poor run where you actually hurt your subsequent runs. In theory, you get a resource which you spend to make yourself stronger. As you unlock items you get to use them for free in your next run. But if you have a bud run then, and don't manage to gather enough stuff, your next run will be without any free goodies. This can lead to a very hard cycle of having bad runs  with little progress. It can make the early game grindy and frustrating. 

But it also tickles your desire to return to the enemies with improved strategies and tactics. There's few things as satisfying as beating a boss you've tried to beat 10 times before. (Maybe I'm just that bad at the game tho)

0,138317292,1159690,"I'm about 22 hours in and I'm kinda bored with the mechanics of the game, 80% of the game so far is floating around grappling items in. 20% is visiting depots, which so far are all the same.
Cons:
Small stacks and even smaller storage boxes.
Upgrading to a tier 2 workbench and having to keep the tier 1 cause 2 won't make the previous items as well.
Not much of a variety in resources, just sub-component after sub-component to try and add complexity rather than just giving new resources to play with.
After 22 hours I still don't have walls or a roof or any decorations for that matter, just open platforms loaded with unnecessary workbenches
Not much in terms of automation for resource collecting so far so plan to spend most of the game floating around collecting items.

0,138318059,2349830,"This game is rather simple yet interestingly thought out.
A resident evil inventory system with a survival swarm game play of vampire survival, but it's touhou.

Each weapon you pick up, you get a cool down for the weapon. Said weapon starts on cool down upon acquirement. 
Putting certain items together gives you a spell card attack, simply a very strong bonus attack with a long cool down.
Picking a character has it's own starting weapon that doesn't take any inventory.

As of writing this, my favorite weapons so far are the magic bombs, keystone, Kogasa's umbrella and yin yang orb.
I like them the most mainly for the high damage and AOE output they give, which is very needed for surviving the first 15 minutes in this game. Getting one of them early is basically an easy grind for points.

I absolutely hate the Aya camera weapon. It's slow, lacks damage and you are forced to aim the weapon with WASD. One suggestion i would make over the ""Press SHIFT Key to lock your direction"" to ""Your mouse courser is where you aim"". 
Until then I do not consider this weapon... as a weapon. It's far too slow, takes too much inventory slots (4) when 4 single slotted weapons can do so much more and that I never depend on it. Make me never play Aya because of it.

The Spell cards I have been lucky enough to get is Fantasy Seal and Master Spark. Both play very different roles and if you get both, of boy everything just starts melting.

FS pros and cons:
+It hits basically everything on the screen
+Flashy and is a different colour each time.
+Reasonable Cool down
+Very high damage output
-Doesn't follow the player while while swirling away

MS pros and cons:
+Almost anything that stays in the attack get eviscerated in no more than 2 seconds.
+Hits basically everything in front of the character
+You can whip it (the best part)
-Depends on other weapons to cover your flank and sides
-Lacks the >love coloured< in the spark (It's a flash of white light)
-Long cool down

Lastly, there are two things I see wrong in the game

One, when pausing the game while the game is starting, normally the music stops, which it does, but in this case it just starts the song again. Luckily you can fix that by just unpausing the game.

The second problem is a when you hit play... you can go to the previous page when you hit play. You are forced to pick a character and play the game instead of going back or alt+f4 the game and reboot it. It's annoying since I wanted to check the items needed to get the other 3 spell cards that are currently in the game. I hope the dev adds the option so that I can also click 'quit game' after I'm done browsing instead of being forced into a game.

Over all, the game is good. Quick and easy to understand, difficulty spike around 16 minutes in, the only difference in each character is sprite and starting weapon. The game (0.99 euro) even costs less than a snickers bar here in Ireland which costs 1.40 euro for a single.

Run from here u chicken!",1
0,138319361,1277920,"Avoid the game until a few months down the road. In its current state its a borderline scam, i say borderline, because it is basically a pre alpha demanding from you to sub. If you don't sub, you are restricted to the Alpha demo( The solitary isle). This Alpha demo actually is farr more complete than the actual game. Essentially this dev team did zero beta or alpha testing for there actual product they are charging you for. Its a classic bait and switch ""Scam"" money grab, whatever you want to call it. Don't get me wrong there is something special here, but it wont go far with how incomplete and buggy the game is.

The developer of this game is also a pathological liar, and filled with enough hubris it could block out the sun. Nearly most of what he promised prior to launch was a complete fabrication. I would argue this game should probably be taken down from steam, but the cat is out of the bag. The only real Pro i can say about these devs , is that they update very quickly and try to fix issues, usually 1-2 days at a time. Sadly they break 15 different things in the process. The game simply was never tested outside of its demo. Speaking of which the demo is actually a very pleasant experience when the servers are working, its the only part of the game that had any real polish, but im assuming its this way for the bait and switch  to work.

The game's servers are made of string and tape. The lead developer bragged prior to launch that his cheap servers were amazing and that if any dev needed expensive servers, they were bad at their job. Funny right. They claimed servers could hold 5k players, it literally explodes with less than 100. Nearly every thing that was claimed by the dev's was either a flat out lie or very very misleading. 

Make no mistake this is a pre alpha game %100, being run by 4 devs 2 of which are coders. Now if you want to give them your money to experience a buggy broken walking simulator wasteland  because you believe in what the game could be, knock yourself out. This game is a perfect example of how far indie development has inched towards just straight up scamming people. This game needs to go back into the oven for another 1-2 years.",0

AOW4 actually handles this layer very well, and in military terms somewhat better some much more famous titles. Where it really shines though, is the tactical layer.

0,138319018,1940340,"As someone who thinks the original game was awesome, I'm a little disappointed by the second installment. My biggest complaints are thus, this game feels far more RNG reliant than the first, the relationship mechanics while interesting are kinda shit, and the focus on the meta progression is awful. When you first start up it feels like you're playing a quarter of a game. You only have some characters available, and while I was able to finish my first run and knew to unlock the others from watching streams, not every player will, and will just be left using half the roster with half their abilities available to them. 

It's wild that they put so much behind meta progression, but then made unlocking a character's moves something you have to actually do in game. It feels awful, as it severely limits and slows down your ability to unlock character's various skills. You'll have to put in likely dozens of runs before you are able to unlock all the abilities in the game, and that's a lot just to get to what is essentially the starting line. 

The RNG in this game feels far more punishing than the first. In the first you could assemble a crack team of explorers, with the express intent of entering a dungeon they were specialized in. Now you have to assemble a group and go through the whole chapter, and it doesn't feel great, as different zones have different debuffs and resistances and there is no way to be prepared for all of it. For the second installment of a game that was almost entirely about preparation, this is a very bitter pill to swallow. Also the marking system is kinda trash, and it makes some characters (jester) feel like they need to be in any comp if you want it to be good.

And finally the relationship mechanics. This to me is possibly the most painful part, as this was an interesting change that I like in theory. In practice it feels like just another way for the RNG system to arbitrarily decide that you lose now. The relationship system is a pair of shackles that exists so that no matter how well you perform, there's always the chance for you to suddenly just snowball to oblivion. That is not good. Every time my goons decide to randomly bully the plague doctor so she now hates the rest of the party and now every time she does anything a slew of debuffs fly, it feels like I have no agency, like I'm not in control of what is happening in this video game. Maybe that's the point, but that doesn't make it less shit.

The comedic irony of it all is that the game has an opener where it says ""this game is about making the best of a bad situation"" while in itself being the bad situation in question. This entire game is a bad situation, you can play it and make the best of it, but darkest dungeon 1 hasn't gone anywhere, and it's genuinely a better game.

Really cool concept, but it  went out on the market way too early, even for a beta. This game needs at least a good year and a half of development just to implement basic unit AI, UI, and simple controls, to make it somewhat enjoyable to play.

0,138321993,1940340,"Honestly I prefer this type of gameplay to the one we had in the first game. In DD1 progression was quickly stalled by the ever growing need of having resources to upgrade the town and pay for your heroes mental care. In the end it became just a grind where you made hordes of disposable parties that just went in, gathered as much loot as possible while ignoring health/sanity. Losing your main party was also a huge setback where you pretty much felt like you had to start from scratch. This lead me to quickly get discouraged by the difficulty as every failure meant hours of grind so as to get back to the point where you had died.
In the current format, since it's presented as a roguelite, failure feels a lot less punishing and more like a necessity for class/character progression. If your party dies well tough luck. The next adventure will most likely be very different especially if you pick different zones at the inn. Something DD1 lacked imo since you would most likely just redo the same low level dungeons to level-up your new party after losing you last one.
In the end it's all about feelings, personally I got tiered of the grind and the difficulty of DD1 where you pretty much had to pause your main adventure so as to grind and better equip yourself or get crushed by difficulty spikes, here you have to play until you end your campaign and start over thus every playtrough having a clear beginning and an end feels like it will tire the player out a lot less in the long run.",1

It's more of a spin off rather than a sequel. Don't come into this with a DD1 mindset or you'll have a bad time as they leaned VERY heavily into the roguelite genre. Pretty enjoyable when you drop that expectation and view it as something entirely new.

Also, where's crusader wtf?

Though I miss the general concept of the first game~ I loved naming my party members, getting attached, and doing anything to avoid death... but in DD2 you're pretty much expected to throw your parties into hell over and over and just let them die as there's no penalty (in fact it's more rewarding) until you get enough upgrade materials to beat the boss of a zone. Winning doesn't feel nearly as impact when I'm not risking the lives of heroes I've grown attached to.

You're not expected to blast through on the first few runs when you're still learning synergies, items, what each area holds, enemy types etc.
""My heroes abilities don't seem that great"" - That's because your team synergy/combos are not great, either because you don't have better abilities chosen or your team formation isn't correct.

Originally I wasn't a big fan of the new combat system, especially the tokens, but now it feels more intuitive than in DD1, especially with the removal of dodge. I also love how the heroes are now individual, recurring charaters, with fleshed out backstories and personalities (the various reactions to inn items are great), as I feel it fits the setting of DD2 better than if they stuck with the stagecoach again.

I can see how people who love the original might dislike some of the many changes made. I personally prefer the rougelike aspect of this one, as I would often get burnt out on DD1 before I got to the endgame. The only things I don't really like is forcing skill swaps due to negative relationships (though there are several ways to increase relationship points so this hasn't been a big problem as of yet), and runs taking a bit too long for my liking (3+ hours when I ""try"" to play optimally.)

You got giant robots fighting other giant robots, massive flying battleships, balls of steel rolling around and the game becomes very chaotic the longer it goes on, to the point my PC starts to lag due to the sheer amount of units that are on-screen, you can launch nukes to starve off defeat for one more round and maybe even turn the match around and win.

2v2 is the most fun I've had playing an auto-battler but it definitely needs to speed up the action, most matches last 20-30 mins but half of that time is just spent watching one of your units slowly walk its way to another slowly walking enemy unit because everything else has died, other than that I have no issues with it, it already speeds up after a minute of action passes but I feel like it should speed up much sooner.

Not being able to easily move your units around on the battlefield makes for a really interesting give-and-take as you play.  You place units in response to your opponent's choices, and you try to anticipate their countermoves.  Units that you think are totally countered and useless can all of a sudden become linchpins in your strategy.  The balance is superb, too.

No. Is it still a great game? Yes. Given the quality of the trailers and leaks i had expected the game to be a bit better looking in graphics, as I do have settings on Ultra with every setting turned to the max, yet it still does not look as good as the trailers. 

Moving on from the graphics side, the game play is not half bad. It seems any headshot from any distance is a 1 hit kill, which to be fair is more realistic than other shooting games where you may have to hit 2/3 headshots for a kill. The melee kills are BRUTAL, by far some of the best i've seen in the series, but overall the gun mechanics are a bit mid.

The NPC's, low-key broken. In the first cut scene, 2 NPC's are scared you broke into their house, but they just stand still fixed looking at 1 location, they don't move or anything, even if you move behind them, they are still looking at the window scared. Enemies whilst running can run fairly oddly, running in random directions at faster than usual speeds.

For everyone shitting on Ubisoft, I don't really give a rats ass if the company are going bankrupt or doing certain ethical things, a game is a game. Far Cry 6 is a game with a lot of effort put into it and overall came out as a great game. A little bit more attention to detail would have been great, with NPC reactions or random decals and objects, as i have noticed a few floating bushes or boxes, but very very few. 8.5/10 for me as there is potential for it to be better.",1
0,138321780,2369390,"PSA 1: Ubisoft launcher saves do not carry over, be that with their game subscription service or the game itself, you will start from the beginning. 
PSA 2: The micro-stuttering due to auto saves when an item is picked up, say a resource or whatever like metal, medicine etc will cause frame drops that only get worse the further into the game you go. 

These problems have not been fixed in Far Cry 5, now they are back in Far Cry 6 to a much larger degree (also in Valhalla with opal pickups). Tickets have been made, time and time again but the problem remains for over 2 years alongside previous games. In Far Cry 5 we could fix this problem with modding, no idea if we can with 6, but it all stems from AUTOSAVE 
That icon in the top right whenever you pic something up. 

I will update if I ever find a fix, ini file changes don't help / work at all so I expect it has something to do with anti cheat, cloud saves or ubisoft overlays.

This game has a ton of bugs still as well, including changing FoV to 70 when swiming, riding horse etc etc despite allowing you to change it to 120, it will revert whenever in car, horse, plane etc etc. That is fixable with HXD Editor
1.Open HXD editor
2.Ctrl + O to open the Far Cry 6\bin\FC_m64d3d12.dll file
3.Ctrl + R to find & replace
4.Change tab to Hex values (not string tab)
5.Find 84 D2 74 19 F3 0F 10 05 and replace with 84 D2 74 00 F3 0F 10 05
6.Should find and replace 1 instance
7.Save file

0,138322079,1669000,"Preliminary note: I never played any of the previous AoW games, ergo I can't comment how this game fares compared to its predecessors.

I might have a problem. I start the game promising myself only a couple of turns - I end up at some point realizing, that it's 4AM. I can't pinpoint exactly what is it about AoW4, but it definitely has the ""one more turn"" bug that, once settles, won't let you free. I am quite aware about game's weaknesses, namely: passive/vexing AI, that will rather settle near your borders to nick the most juicy provinces under your belt, instead of properly attacking you; occasional bugs (albeit they are fixed quite quickly); completely forgettable soundtrack. I also see through the lines, that even the biggest pros of AoW4 are somewhat... overstated. At some point you realize, that the ""race transformations"" are quite limited and repeatable. That there are certain combos that work well, so you most likely will follow a couple progression paths, just with an added flavour of your race sometimes looking Orkish, sometimes Elvish, sometimes Human. And anyway your endgame units ain't part of your race, but some mythical creatures that you need to summon and that will always look samey, regardless whether you play as demonic moles or holy rats.

Yes somehow I keep playing... I used to love Amplitude Studios and their ""soft"" French style. Yet, playing Endless Legends, usually I was done with a game after one campaign. Same with Civ6 - ok, here is my 10, 15 hours as some new Civ, thanks game, see you in 2 months, maybe in a quarter. Here, having seen my mana addicted moles ascend to godhood, I went straight to play superevil dwarfs, employing their awesome constructs to spread destruction and misery (any similarities to Dawi-Zharr are completely accidental). Addiction is strong in this one.

On the side note, one positive thing to definitely point out as unique is actually not the race creation - but realm creation. THIS is the definite replayability multiplier. You wanna play on a manawinds-scorched map? Deal. Or perhaps you want to try your luck on a constantly evolving terrain, that can blow under your very feet? You're welcome. How about playing a race of felines against a Frozen Witch, that starts with a huge empire and is out there hunting for your fur? Go ahead, make C.S. Lewis proud.

And one thing that keeps me slightly worried is... wel, Paradox. Maybe the reason why i keep playing until the dim morning light starts knocking on my windows is... knowing that this here is the game in its most pristine form. And somewhere along the line, 2, maybe 3 years ahead, is a bloated mess of DLCs, parasitic mechanics and power creeped races, akin to Stellaris. I hope i am wrong. I hope the game can grow and add new customization options, schools of magic or units, yet still retain its clarity of form. Fingers crossed.",1
0,138321765,1669000,"Fantastic remix of a fantasy 4X. Love the decision to break the race appearance from their abilities and the highly customizable archetypes. Expanding and exploring feels smooth, and the battles are fun, with a rock-solid auto-resolve (with the option to re-do it manually if you're not happy with how the AI acted).

Weak sports are that the performance is a bit sluggish (for the visuals, that are fine, but don't justify the whirrrr of my fans), and the sound design being overall mediocre. Elements of the game (rare resources, always giving whispering stones, etc) do get a little repetitive on multiple starts.

0,138322773,1940340,"I wont use DD1 as a comparative base.

 The movement through the world of DD2 uses a map much like FTL or Slay The Spire. The difference being that in DD2 you must actually travel between these points instead of ""teleporting"" between them. This travel is essentially pointless, and I can press a single button and allow it to autopilot without much issue.
 The last ""act"" I ran through in DD2 took me 23 minutes to complete. I spent 3 minutes and 10 seconds of that time waiting for the cart to move. Ignoring all other factors that may take time, this means I'm I'm forced to spend 9 minutes and 30 seconds per hour doing NOTHING if I want to play this game. Think about watching 10 minutes of ads per hour on one of your favorite mediums and that is how I feel about it.

If the game was inspiring, I might be able to deal with it. But there is little choice to make, very little meaningful progression during a run (the first encounter feels almost the same as some of the final ones), the meta progression is slow and doesn't inspire me to try new things, and the encounters themselves are generic. 

Most roguelikes/lites bite me and give me obsession with the combinations that can be made and the things I want to test. I keep unlocking things in DD2 hoping it picks up at some point, because the game is a slog, a grind, and at no point thus far have I had any fun with it.",0

0,138322833,669330,"Mechabellum is fun is the simplest review I could give.

To say more, autobattlers sometimes struggle from feeling too helpless. Mechabellum gets around this by taking place over many rounds with a health point system where you genuinely feel you can reverse the outcome of the match. 

The variety of units is nice, the upgrades are plentiful and the cards you gain inbetween rounds are impactful but also seem relatively balanced. 

Updates would also be easy to foresee, new units, cards, map interactions or even gamemodes could be added and would be super fun to play through.

One extra thing to add, there is plentiful single player content from survival mode to solving other people's lost matches or fictitious scenarios. If you aren't immediately turned off by autobattlers, give this a go.

The only negatives I have found are:
- The menu and UI are ugly and unadjustable (in particular, the text size is absolutely tiny on smaller screens, adjustable UI would help)
- The combat power system only goes up so it has no real meaning though I imagine this will change throughout early access.
- It runs suprisingly poorly on my relatively low end device.
- The tutorial, whilst helpful, is not as comprehensive as you might like. Especially regarding special powers of the command towers and an explanation of the game's jargon.",1

I think it is sad that Ubisoft continues to follow the trend of diverging from the original ideas of games. I will talk about my positive thoughts at the end just because I believe the negatives are more pertinent. I simply don't understand the purpose of a mad max aesthetic. I just find incredibly silly. Unlike previous titles where you are able to carry three long guns and a sidearm in this game instead of the third long gun you can carry a resolver weapon which are mad max looking silly blade launchers and things like that. If that's your thing you will be in to it I'm sure. Also, I do not know if its because I am becoming more cynical with age, but I am incredibly dissapointed that I find myself skipping cutscenes because I simply don't care. I just hit the point in the game where I was announced there is an in game currency with micro transactions. I don't have much to say on this. I just cannot understand how a game you pay for has micro transactions. I just don't understand that's all I can say lol I will leave it to the pros to scream about it. I feel no incentive to play in stealth in this game unlike previous titles. The time to kill is somehow incredibly long but the game is incredibly easy so far. The game has none of the feeling of Far Cry 4 and obviously Far Cry 3. A classic huge Ubisoft map that I don't give a shit about discovering. Also weirdly often when I alt-tab to switch to the next episode of Sopranos because Ubisoft didn't event try to make me give a shit about the characters, when I come back in to the game my framerate is less than 15 and I have to restart the game. Very weird, 200 fps normally. This game is not like the far cry's of olden days. It has its fair share of lets just call it twitterness with its characters I am going to leave it at that you can discuss below. Good things about the game...  The designers clearly cared and the put effort in to their work. I just really think there are the wrong people making decisions about what the product should look like, but of course I know jack shit. Adding horses was cool, that should have been in Far Cry 5, i think there might be helis and planes but I'm not sure, if so very cool. Graphics and such look nice. I was not expecting a Witcher 3 open world. and I came in with super low expectations and I am happy to say the game honestly met my expectations. If 15 bucks ain't much to you and you wanna try it try it. If 15 bucks is something to you I would say stay away.",0

0,138323279,855740,"Hobo: Tough Life is far better in nearly every way. It does seem to have been slightly inspired by this game. There are some cool things I like in this game compared to that one though. I do like the idea of having a shopping cart with you. I also like having to write the sign that you're going to use to beg with. 

The writing is absolutely atrocious. The 'rich guy' is dressed in some green suit with a green top hat and says something to the effect of 'As a rich guy, I like to degrade the poor because that's just what we rich guys do'. Who talks like this? The voice of the pigeon lady is far louder than anything else, the audio was not normalized. The style completely tries to imitate Grand Theft Auto but just lacks the polish to pull it off. It would be better to have its own style in this case. You can get stars like grand theft auto, but it doesn't seem to mean anything, as a 4 star vs a 1 star was exactly the same and cleared just as quickly. 

I only got an hour in to it but the combat was extremely easy. Maybe it gets harder.

I ran in to a bug a few times where the X axis on the mouse froze up, but switching between fighting/begging/pigeon modes seemed to fix this. Not a big deal really. 

The protagonist is literally incapable of any kind of speech. I guess this is an attempt at humor? It kind of limits story/narrative, even with a sentient talking shopping cart. 

I wanted to like this game, but's it's too rough to continue with. Hopefully there will be more games to come in the bum simulator type genre.

My run was flawless until I got to the Obsession boss, it applies a stacking healing reduction AND does insane damage each turn. You rapidly reach a point where nobody can be healed. Hard is fine, but the final boss should reflect the actual experience to get there. This was night and day.

A disappointing 45 minutes later, I discovered that these games aren't typically played ""live"" but rather ""by email."" Now, the games can be played live and with the proper settings, a live game can be finished in a couple hours. However, we have no ability to name our game lobbies and therefore attract the ""live"" players. 

Soooo, I join the discord. Meet other players interested in cranking out a live match. Play several live matches... EVERY SINGLE ONE IS BROKEN. Out of syncs, crashes and the game just not progressing for any conceivable reason. I do not buy games to play single player. I would not ever purchase a single player game. The multiplayer is not even remotely playable for more than a 1v1. Which even, if fixed, still leaves the disaster of matchmaking.",0
0,138325159,1669000,"A conglomerate mix of the last three games with some new ideas. Still only one throne city. A limit of only three cities per player; owning more causes an excessive income penalty. A massive amount of upgrades, side quests, and income structures... Haven't seen if they have a teleportation gate on this, but they have a version of a tower guard. Units still require the seafaring upgrade in order to enter ships. Graphics are a bit dated, but that just makes it so it can be played on a much wider variety of platforms without taking up a ton of space on your drives. 
The turns still take forever. Upgrading your structures takes forever. Building advanced units takes forever also, but at least you can hurry production if you have enough gold.

I also find the addition of previous wizards very tongue and cheek :)

If you have a lot of free time to waste, it's not a bad way to waste it.

0,138325452,1179580,"For the $32.48(AUD) introductory price.

I must say that I am enjoying it so far.

It is a simple open world action RPG game.

We have been disappointed with the bigger known companies giving us horrible games lately, so why not support a smaller company/developer instead.

Rather than spending $80-$100 on a piece of crap, let us spend $20-$30 on an Early Access game so they can make it better for everyone and as it says, that the game has ""-A complete main story line with over 30 hours of game play."".

Movement is fine.

Combat is fine.

Aiming is fine.

It is not mind blowing or great or up to the standards of certain AA or AAA games but for the price tag, what do people expect?

The story seems alright so far as the first hour is more like a Tutorial until you get to a certain part, then it opens up on the world in which it tells you what has happened and what you need to do.

I'd say overall, the game is not too bad and as I am enjoying it so far, I will give it a positive review and recommend others to support the smaller companies.

- Lacks the epic score music of the first game. Which is weird, because this is the same composer.
- Has almost none of the tension that made the original practically a new genre
- Difficulty based on RNG
- Roguelite elements feel last minute and unlocks don't feel particularly exciting
- No gamepad support off the bat, will be patched by devs later
- Over-reliance on the community to fix the issues with mods, but modding is not implemented yet (???)
- Managing the stagecoach is an awesome idea, but practically in game it feels unsatisfying and a chore
- Character relationships is an awesome idea executed poorly

I will say however that the narrator (Wayne June) is the strongest point as always and while the material given to him to read in this sequel is not as strong as the first, it is practically worth *the entire purchase price*.

0,138325763,1940340,"TLDR: It's Slay the Spire in a Darkest Dungeon coat. 


I want to love this game, because the first was one of the most challenging and engaging gaming experiences I've ever experienced. I am still playing Darkest Dungeon 1 even now. But...this game has no depth. 

For items and builds, it went from learning about a region and exploring to 
Fire area = burn heal
Forest = blight heal

And that's it. You're playing Pokemon basically. 

Another issue with this change from regions to path clears (I guess?) is the lack of variety in your comps. You have to spam the #### out of a consistent set of four or five to unlock their abilities. It isn't about your ability to create strong compositions, it's about buffing the obviously best units so you can push further into other runs to get actually new ""content"". 

I was legitimately excited about the relationship system...until I actually played it. Nutshell version: most playthroughs two people will love eachother and two will hate eachother. Pray like hell the two that hate eachother don't put negative traits on your best abilities (but, they probably will). 


What killed the game for me in so many regards is not being able to properly lock in character traits. You have to keep playing them back to back or you will lose their traits and any memories you worked incredibly hard for. So, if you get bored of using the same comp for the 5th run in a row - congrats, you lose all progress. 
These aren't your characters anymore. Unlike the first DD, where you fought like hell (and prayed equally) with your characters to survive and overcome the challenges, DD2 just goes ""eh"" and literally chucks them in a ditch with a broken carriage.

It takes away the most important aspect of Darkest Dungeon - the fear of losing your team, whether because you care about them or just from the work put into them, and replaces it with a grind even WoW players would raise an eyebrow at. The game doesn't give you a reason to care. So why should you?",0

0,138325643,1940340,"I had played this for a few hours and prob close to a hundred on the first one so I like to give my personal opinions on one of my favorite game. 
First: The two game are not the same. While some mechanic like stress and the brutal combat is still similar and almost the same in most aspect, the upgrade is still vaguely familiar. The comparison stop there.
Second: The first game you play like a leader of a doomed mercenary group allowing you to hire and fire any characters you like to siege the Darkest Dungeon. In this game you play as a leader of said mercenary group responsible for keeping the people in your team to survive as long as you can.
Third: Some people complain that this game is not similar enough to the previous one should just keep playing the first one because it still a perfect game that can probably give you several hundred hours more of game play.

It looks like it's maybe clipped through the floor but in reality it's just in a storage within a menu. Another is that the broken atv you find is deliberately slow, it says this in the text but people don't read and realise they need to build a new one to get faster.

0,138326218,669330,"Really interesting game with a lot of potential! Here are a few ideas I had whilst playing.

I'd really like if there was a rematch button.

Wish that air units had a few more unit options, as they feel a little underutilized compared to the ground units.

Wish the unit roster was slightly larger in general.

I think it would be fun if there were a few more nonconventional units like the hacker.

I found this personally more engaging than other autobattle type games like tabs and teamfight tactics.

There feels like there are some slight roguelike elements with gathering different modules and applying them to the right units.

Airstrikes and uno-reverse card abilities are a good way to level the playing field if you're falling behind. However, this requires a decent amount of forethought, as these abilities are usually pretty resource intensive. Ideally these should compliment your strategy instead of acting as a crutch.

Would maybe be interesting to include other buildings except the energy towers.

The core thought of trying to make the game balanced and truly strategic is interesting, and I am very curious where it will go throughout its development. Often I feel like video games made with the ambition of it being competitive and therefore decently fair tends to make the game stale, sacrificing many of the creative advantages of the video game as a format. Truly fun but also competitive games are rare.

I wish the devs good luck with development. I find the current state of the product impressive, but with room for complexity. I have hope that they can deliver on something that hasn't really been done in this way as far as I know.",1

This game has soo many features, its truly a software marvel BUT, we've seen it all before. Copy and pasting the same formula over and over again is the same reason Nitro Pepsi  failed so hard, its not an original idea.

Far Cry 5 was nice for the change but had horrible execution and TERRIBLE DLC, Far Cry 6 is just a far cry with every other aspect of a Ubisoft  game that was remotely successful, or they've overloaded their memories to what is successful and cram it all into the same box: they've forgotten how to do anything else or even learn from their mistakes or be original in their ideas of creation. 

Far Cry 6 is just another Far Cry that was, stupidly, held off of Steam. The game itself looks great, has decent gun play but a lot of bugs and FPS drops on capable hardware.

0,138327327,1940340,"This game is so weird to give a judgement on since it's clearly something fantastic with a lot of potential, but for every step forward, there's one back in another direction. None of the changes come without an issue.

The game is now much more traditional of a roguelike, similar to Slay The Spire. This change can be a hit or miss for some people, but I personally love the change. There are varied reasons to choose each route and the variety on items can either ruin a run or save it on a coin flip, which is part of the essence of darkest dungeon. 
The issue is, these runs are so damn long. An average run going to the boss of Act 2 onwards can easily take over an hour. Going through all this effort just to lose due to a bad dice roll can feel incredibly shitty, or having to slog through with a mediocre build just to suffer at the end can really make it feel like the game does not respect your time. But... that's also kind of the essence of darkest dungeon.

The combat system is fantastic, I love how the game simplified aspects of the previous game and expanded others, its led to a much more engaging experience when fighting enemies since there are so many moving parts. The UI in battles is also quite a downgrade in utility, but better visually. It looks great, but the game tells you very little about anything upfront. Having to inspect enemies to view what they do, not being able to view other heroes abilities or estimated damage. This makes calculating and planning much harder to do in combat, since you basically need to estimate numbers and wait until the game allows you to finish a thought process. Nevertheless, the combat is still incredibly fun, challenging, and satisfying.

I love the idea of Paths. Each character having variety in archetypes that buff certain play styles. However, a lot of these feel incredibly niche or unfun. Some specifically buff one specific attack a hero has, basically forcing them to be a one trick pony, while others are almost un-noticeable. The best ones in the game belong to Grave robber, Vestal and Flagellant (the two latest characters added...) that have Paths that not only give stat changes, but rework skills to work differently at a base level, or make more niche skills significantly better than your previous bread and butter. This should be what they all were like! It leads to a meaningful choice and more variety on what roles each character can fill. If there is a meaningful rework to the paths, I pray that they all end up like this. (though a small improvement would be if the game actually told you what was being changed between each path for each skill, instead of just saying ""adjusted skills."")

An issue I really cannot defend is the tutorials and introductions to the game. This game has an abhorrent new player experience due to how poorly it conveys what its systems are. Discover a new mechanic? Consult the novel that breaks half the time to mark every tutorial as read so you do not even know what the game just added into it. Unsure of a system? Scroll through and guess where it is. Even after that, there are still so many mechanics unexplained. I didn't know that different Inn's grant different bonuses based on the icon in the top left. The game never says that, but it says so much more that feels unnecessary. These things can be done in a much better way, this just feels lazy. The Combat glossary is also a major misstep. If the combat requires a cheat sheet to understand icons, then the icons are not doing their job of simplifying things, they are adding another step. If they kept the idea of just adding words, people would be able to assume what it does. It does not help that some icons shown in abilities don't actually show up in the cheat sheet, while some exclusive to one single enemy with an unhelpful description do. It just screams a system made for those who already understand it, and a tutorial made that just assumes the player already gets the gist of it. Thankfully I did, but a new player shouldn't be assumed to know everything the game is trying to do.

Lastly, this game really needs a bit of polish in terms of bugs, hiccups, and oversights. Nothing game breaking, but small signs that makes the 1.0 seem less like a full release. Any time the game is closed directly to desktop, every setting reverts to default. Character names don't save between runs if you have customised them, always reverting to default. FPS drops any time that rain is showing. UI being clunky to navigate since every keybind is scattered across the keyboard (and the previous setting bug means rebinding them is a waste of time.) These should've been caught in early access really. It is just disappointing to find so many small signs of carelessness in a product that is so bursting with care in other parts.

I'm sure it goes without saying but visually and audibly the game is phenomenal. I have 0 problems with how the game looks and sounds. They clearly put tons of effort into this, but the rough edges really need some ironing out. I would highly recommend this game, but I don't think the dev's should pat themselves on the back and say that their product is done (which, in fairness, they haven't done.)

0,138327631,2369390,"I love the Far Cry franchise and have completed every single game while enjoying it to the max, perhaps this was the reason I bought Far Cry 6 without a second thought but now as I'm in the middle of the game, I'm facing plenty on bugs like character getting stuck, car disappearing, enemy one shot killing me at full health.
Also I need to address that Ubisoft has completely altered the parkour mechanics to a pile of shit, I'm not saying that old Far Cry's had it better but this one feels like it's struggling allot even to climb simple ladder.
I'm not sure if I'm the only one facing this issue of the character not climbing a simple ledge of the height of he's knee, forgetting to vault over obstacles and overall making the parkour even more clunky than it was, basically I'm feeling the lack of freedom while freerunning which was never the problem before on older entries. The story is good but not great, anyways I dont care bout the story anyways cuz I'm more of a fan of the action in it but an addition of a better or a unique story would have been appreciated. The WORST part is Ubisoft Connect, the name is ironical to it's service and I CAN NOT make it connect online what so ever hence not able to cloud save my data at all, I wanna say this to Ubi (If you dont know how to make a launcher then please learn, just changing the name from Uplay to the current one won't change a thing, or just drop it) running Ubisoft Connect has been a nightmare also lost all my Ubi points as well still don't know how and why?!. Anyways....aside from the bad part, there's also gems beneath being the beautiful graphics and the tropical island settings with a ton of different weapons and vehicles to choose from to suite your style of play. I still think that this frenchise is far from over and I havent lost all hope in it yet like Assassin's creed. Hope Ubi dosent messes this up as well.

0,130416381,2220480,"This one is a bit of an acquired taste for sure. A bullet heaven with a fairly weak presentation in terms of graphics, core gameplay (it's one of those without auto-shooting, for the most part), with basic weaponry such as pistols and shotguns and even the first match or two certainly won't feel like one of the greatests around. Takes a while to become truly strong, and it's very easy to die. There's a few interesting ideas however, such as constantly refreshing and upgradable shop to buy upgrades in rather than straight level up rewards, a couple fun abilities to use, a gacha-esque way to unlock extra content quicker and specific characters to unlock harder versions of the various levels in the game, and the power increments have the player absolutely spray bullets in no time. So yeah, it takes a little bit of time to get there, but Burst Hero is already fun and surprisingly deep in this current version of Early Access.

Overall it's a fun game it reminds me of brotato with less classes, but more roguelike elements. I do dislike how the mobs spawn in circles around you so close as it makes some weapons/classes feel insanely underwhelming. I don't know how the world you beat the second map either it's insane the dogs literally jumped across screen to destroy me. I think it'd be a fun game to grind and I like the gacha way of unlocking things, but it definitely feels a bit unfair at times.",1

It just came out today and I've played for hours without a single crash. Not even a bug to report! That alone says a lot about it. Tons of replay ability with a very fresh feel. At launch it dropped with 8 hero's. Each one has different abilities and weapons. Getting this game for $2.50 feels like a steal and I can't wait to see what's next for it. After a few more days with this game, it might make my MUST BUY LIST!

This game is pretty decent for a fighting game. It's fairly well made, you can tell the creators put a lot of effort into it.
The sprite work is really good, the sounds are good, the music is great, and it's got good netcode.
The game comes with a couple of modes too, which you wouldn't think a free fighting game would come with, including a neat ""rpg-style endurance-ish"" mode where you get items and accessories that change up the fights, and you fight against NPCs with different effects during the fight, like low gravity or having to survive an invincible opponent.

The combat mechanics are really well done too. The combos feel good, the special moves are nice, the supers are pretty sweet, and you get assists called collabs (but you can't assist spam in this game thankfully!).

Honestly I recommend anyone who likes fighting games to give it a try, it's free~ 

The only issues I have with the game so far are I wish there was a lobby system for online mode, and sometimes during fights my grabs will whiff on grabbable opponents, which sucks because I main Coco which is the grappler. 
(There was even one time where I was standing next to the opponent, I used my grab and it whiffed, and they grabbed me immediately after! Annoying...)

P.S. Don't play Coco during single player games, the NPC cheats like fuck and will cancel every normal grab and jump away from every command grab! This pissed me off when I was playing the various modes to unlock her colors, why play a grappler when the NPC will cheat to not let me grab? Make the command grab a 0-frame grab like in other games so the NPC can't jump out by reading your button inputs!!!",1

0,138328840,1940340,"As someone who has over 800+ hours in DD1 and also waited until this game was out of EA (Early Access) to play it, I gotta say I have been enjoying my time with it.
Granted, you have to be a particular kind of gamer/person to enjoy DD as a concept anyways, but I think DD2 fixed some of the problems with the RNG from DD1 by basically giving you the option to be as adventurous or as curious as you'd like to be without it having that big of a repercussions: like, yeah, you might lose your run but you don't lose any of the actual meaningful resources that you can use to upgrade your heroes or to unlock other resources for your runs.
I read a handful of negative reviews for DD2 and it really looked like the bulk of the complaints were from people who were expecting DD1.5, and that's fair, some people love that shit and that's why the continue to buy FIFA20XX or CoD 13, but RH (Red Hook) had said from the outset that they want DD2 to actually be a different game while still keeping the core idea of what made DD1 fun and challenging and I think they have succeeded at it.
My only real complaint is that I think the stagecoach driving is a bit lame, but I like that you can get resources by actually interacting with that and not just letting it go on its own basically. Also, it makes my computer run really hot and I'm not entirely sure why but my laptop is also old so who knows.",1
0,138328757,1940340,"tl;dr; It is definitely pretty good with a game lootpwhich is quite different from DD1 and wich still requires some brain power but at different moments. It is definitely a rogue lite game, permanent upgrades are extremly strong but unlock at a satisfying pace.

Cons
- some tooltips require more decrypting than they should
- maybe a bit too enabling for the player, from very early into the game I had consistently strong combinations for my teams
- what I think is the optimal pathing is a bit telegraphed
- I'm far from finishing the content but it seems a bit on the short side
- The price tag is exorbitant for a glorified premium DLC framework

Pros
- The setting and the rythm are pretty good
- The 3D is well executed
- Character design is very neat
- I like the rules
- They nailed the economy, management, decision making elements wich are imho more important than the fights themselve",1

0,138328190,1159690,"I'm currently 27 hours into the game and I enjoy it a lot. Most of the current reviews seem to point out how a lot of the time playing is spent floating around and gathering resources but isn't that what a survival game is. I normally chuck a Youtube video on in the background and just enjoy the environment of this game as i grind out resources. 

However, I have run into an issue with over gathering ruining the game for me as I now have a train full of resources meaning I no longer need to gather anything but also can't progress with my research as I require 1 specific item that I cant obtain. This issue has happened to me twice so far leading to long breaks between me actually doing anything as there is no need for me to gather as I can't research causing me to just sit on the train as it runs and hoping I eventually either progress the story or see the item I require.

There are also issues with the fighting experience. In my opinion the fighting just involves you having an abundance of armour and bandages. As there is no lean or really much ability to avoid the enemies bullets so you are better of just running at them and gunning them down. I also had issues with gun building were I'd want to build a rifle but it kept coming out as a shotgun. Maybe I was missing something but I felt like the gun building was poorly explained.

Overall I still recommend the game although it does have quite a few issues that effect the fun overtime. I reckon it would be better with friends as then you'd have more people gathering you could keep the train constantly running as you'd have someone else to research and manufacture resources causing you to progress the story quicker hopefully reducing those wait times between getting the resources that you need to keep progressing.",1

Like I beat it in less than an hour, but it's not like I 1st tried everything, there's a few fights that took me multiple tries, and there's a non-skippable cutscene before all of them so not like they went fast. There's not a ton going on either, you explore the castle, but like, it's maybe 4 rooms big with not much going on in it to look at really. There's not a ton of lore either, it's just kinda eh, not super fleshed out or anything. Plot of the game itself is fine though, not amazing, but like it's entertaining. Game also will be low frame rate and stutter a lot. Also whatever method they're using to despawn and respawn things outside of camera view is too slow cause you'll see clear to the outside of the castle for a couple moments when you turn around. if you get stuck anywhere, you missed a random e button prompt on something, sometimes it's not clear you were supposed to care about a thing.",1

0,138328452,1559600,"The Ranch of Rivershine is a captivating equestrian game that holds great promise. Although it is still in its early access phase, I'd like to share my thoughts on the game's current state, highlighting its strengths and areas that could be improved.

The gameplay mechanics are smooth and intuitive, making it accessible for both experienced gamers and newcomers. Whether I was exploring the open fields on horseback or taking on quests, the controls were responsive, providing a seamless experience.

Visually, the game is stunning. The horse models are adorable, and the coat variations are visually striking. The cross-country courses offer an enjoyable challenge, and the landscapes are beautifully crafted, immersing players in a picturesque world.

While dressage and show jumping are not featured, I found that the focus on cross-country courses was engaging and satisfying. However, it's worth mentioning that the game's content is currently limited. The closed shops in town and restricted customization options may lead to repetitive gameplay during long sessions. I'm hopeful that future updates will address these limitations and expand the available content.

One area that could be improved is the foal aging process. Currently, it takes seven in-game days for a foal to grow up, which can feel lengthy. Providing options to sell or skip the aging process for unwanted foals would enhance the breeding experience.

Additionally, implementing loading screens during location transitions would improve the overall user experience. The current black screen can be confusing, making players wonder if the game has crashed.

In summary, The Ranch of Rivershine presents a promising equestrian adventure. While it's important to consider its early access status and the need for further updates, the game offers enjoyable gameplay and stunning visuals. With improvements and expansions in the pipeline, I'm excited to see how The Ranch of Rivershine evolves into an even more captivating virtual world.",1
