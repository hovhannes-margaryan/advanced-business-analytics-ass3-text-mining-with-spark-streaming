# Advanced Business Analytics Assignment 3 Text Mining with Spark Streaming

Steam is a popular digital distribution platform for video games. It allows users to purchase and
download games directly to their computers. With features like automatic updates, a strong social
community which in turn generates good deal of data. It includes game reviews that can be both
negative and positive. The goal of the project is to build a model that can use labelled data to train a
model to predict the sentiment of the review. First, data pre‚Äêprocessing is conducted on the dataset. Second, predictive model is built using Pyspark. Third,prediction is performed using livestreamed reviews from Steam. 

The following are the files used for generating the report: 
1)d.csv-reviews from Steam that form the historical database for Step 1 of assignment
2)01_big_data_assignment_3_streaming.ipynb-collection of data from Steam to construct d.csv
3)PREDICTION.ipynb,PREDICTION2.ipynb-models for prediction that are used in report
4)02_big_data_assignment_3_modelling_-models for prediction
5)LIVESTREAM.ipynb-deployment of chosen models for prediction on live streamed reviews
