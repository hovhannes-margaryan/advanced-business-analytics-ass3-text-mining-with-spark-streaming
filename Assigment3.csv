138040898,1494420,"All the negative reviews that are saying that this game needs more, it literally came out 6 days ago, there is ton of potential for this game, and for only $20, in it's current state, is still playable. Give it time before leaving a bad review.",1
138040789,1494420,"I would recommend this games as it has so much potential and it's just getting started.

There are obviously bugs in the game... not the alien kind.

The Good:-
1) Great theme.
2) Interesting fights due to caverns/canyons and build sprawling desert plains
3) Vehicle play is fun
4) Good range of vehicle types, and no hard rock paper scissors.

Bugs/issues include:-
1) Harvesters getting stuck on anything that isn't flat...
2) Harvesters getting stuck trying to enter the refinery.
3) Ordering in Strat mode to attack causes your units to approach to point blank.
4) AI infantry shoot you from a million miles away, they rarely hit.
5) Aliens are too easy to wipe out with a car rush due to their lack of ranged early game and slow speed melee units.
6) Infantry need transports (I've heard that this is coming), please make it so not all die if transport pops en-route...
7) Left clicking on radar map (bottom left) whilst having units selected, so that you can pan your map there whilst having units selected... causes you to deselect those units.
8) Harvester speed feels so slow... especially with issues like described in 1+2.
9) AI behaviour in strat mode (commander) feels like it just sends units on patrol rather than building any effective force.

Requested features:-
1) Vehicle customisation - changing or upgrading weapon from default... maybe ammo upgrade for better penetration in exchange for slower ROF for player vehicles. (Using player requisition points to purchase).
2) Player ordered vehicles, that could be delivered to the front should yours get destroyed, obviously making it destructible as it is being delivered...
3) Commander abilities, Radar ping, supply drop, vehicle drop.
4) Grenades and infantry sidearm (either pistol or PDW).
5) Building range indicator
6) Transports and APC's...
7) Air vehicles",1

138040794,2337630,"I decided to give this game a crack today. I will say, it is lots and lots of fun. Despite a handball going 50 metres up the field, tackling your opponent for holding the ball just for them to get up and kick a goal, and also for your own player to mark the ball just to get tackled for holding the ball, I will give this game the benefit of the doubt as I know they are patching things up as I type this review.

138042907,1940340,"A worthy successor to darkest dungeon 1, and one crafted in a deliberately different fashion in order to not obsolete the first game, as a result leaving both games distinct from one another and both with their own aspects that could improve upon or dimish the original darkest dungeon experience depending on who you are.

In my personal opinion I prefer the second game. It streamlines many aspects of the game by cutting down on grind, improving combat to be more tactical and while I enjoyed the art direction of the first game, this one can be downright jaw-dropping.

In particular I find there is more depth to this game's combat and I also enjoy the themes of the game's story more, so my personal recommendation over these two great games is the second one. (Especially for newcomers to the two games, I think darkest dungeon 2 will be easier to get into.)

Overall an incredible game and a huge congratulations to everyone at red hook for this accomplishment, and It will only improve more as time goes on and the game is updated more as darkest dungeon 1 was.
",1
138042873,1940340,"It feels like they took Darkest Dungeons, removed everything that made that game unique in its class, and pushed out a generic roguelite where nothing really matters in the long run besides you getting the cross-run currency to make your guys only marginally better.

There's also no dungeons in darkest dungeons 2.",0
138042854,1940340,"The first thing you need to know about Darkest Dungeon 2 is that it's NOT its predecessor. While the tactical turn-based combat and unique atmosphere are still there, the structure of the game is entirely different. You will not crawl through any dungeons. You will not permanently lose heroes. You will not spend tens of hours grinding for resources and experience. And, I promise you if you approach with an open mind, chances are high you will not miss any of that.

[b][Core gameplay loop][/b]
The theme of Darkest Dungeon 2 is that of a grueling journey through a bleak world on the brink of collapse. You build a team of four heroes and drive your stagecoach through up to 3 regions composed of nodes connected by branching paths until you either reach the Mountain, give up or die. You will die a lot. The game is very challenging, but fair. When you die it's because you made a mistake and through repeated failure you learn and improve, making for an unforgettably gratifying feeling when you finally master it. The further you get on your journey, the more candles you are awarded with. Flame is synonymous with hope in Darkest Dungeon and candles are valuable currency you can spend at the Altar of Hope to unlock a variety of upgrades that help you on all your future runs. 

As your heroes travel and fight side by side, they develop an affinity for each other depending on the choices you make and the stress your heroes suffer during combat. This affinity then culminates in positive or negative relationships which affect the efficacy of your team for one region. Your stagecoach needs to be maintained, the Flame must be kept alive and bright, your heroes need to be healthy both physically and mentally. The further you get in a region, the harder it will get not to fail on at least one front, which makes long-term planning as vital to your success as the combat tactics you employ. After each region awaits a stop at the inn, allowing you to catch a breather and prepare for the next one or collect your spoils and retire.

[b][Combat and gameplay variety][/b]
The tactical turn-based combat is fast, fluid and very satisfying. Compared to DD1 it's a lot more deterministic with fewer rng elements and it gives you a lot of agency and room for meaningful decision-making. If your big hit has a chance to miss because your character is Blinded, you may remove the negative token with a consumable item to guarantee a hit, use a non-offensive skill and let an ally cure you later, or risk it and attack anyway. 

On the whole the gameplay is complex with lots of little things factoring into your success. Every choice you make has impact and sometimes its effects may reverberate even hours later in subtle ways. The character building in this game is top notch. When I first discovered the full variety of heroes and their skills and subclasses, trinkets and combat items, inn items, quirks, diseases, altar upgrades, memories, stagecoach upgrades and pets, I felt like a poor and starving university student who just came upon a giant free street-food market. My mind was racing with all the possible synergies. The game is reasonably well balanced (though not without some problems), the sheer amount of combinations is tremendous and the vast majority of them are perfectly viable. Enemies are creative and your ability to adapt is always rewarded. Itemization is fantastic, most equipment changes the way a character plays rather than just providing flat buffs and the game cleverly discourages hoarding consumables.

I must also mention how quick and smooth the game feels. Turn-based games often suffer from pacing problems and everything takes forever, but DD2 has never felt like a slog to me. Repetition inevitably sets in after some time as there are only so many regions and enemies in the game, but with the sheer amount of things to experiment with you'll hardly notice. If you enjoy turn-based games or roguelites, this is a treat.

[b][Art, visuals and sound][/b]
The presentation level of Darkest Dungeon 2 is out of this world. The art, animation and sound design team have done a stellar job. The character animations are a treat for the eyes, responsive, sharp, full of detail and care. I still catch myself browsing through a hero's skills only to see them gracefully transition between idles or appreciating how every creature on the brink of death changes pose to a battered, exhausted slouch. The soundtrack by Stuart Chatwood is one masterpiece after another, it would deserve its own review and I strongly encourage you to give it a listen and support him even if the game itself is not for you. Every moment you spend with the game will be narrated by the irreplaceable Wayne June. The sound effects are solid, the art style is consistent and beautifully executed, the world's biomes and inhabitants tell stories through their appearance and sound alone. All of this adds up to an immersive, memorable atmosphere that is simultaneously bleak and hopeful.

[b][Story][/b]
The game is split into 5 acts known as Confessions following the story of the Academic (narrator) and his Protegé who were at the epicentre of the spreading calamity. Each hero also has a personal narrated backstory which, much like the main story, focuses on failure and regret. The emotions are magnified tenfold by the utterly brilliant narrator. In typical Darkest Dungeon fashion most of the story is told in short, narrated segments or via the environment and its inhabitants. Expect no dialogue or novel-like storytelling. Your heroes' situational barks, quirks and relationships as well as your choices make each journey its own self-contained little story.

[b][Technical state][/b]
The devs have maintained a very high standard of quality even throughout Early Access. Nothing goes out that hasn't been tested and bugs have been very rare. Optimization could be a little better as people have on occasion complained about frame drops and poor performance, but you will likely only feel this if you barely meet the modest recommended specs.

[b][Amazing devs][/b]
Early Access launch was met with lots of scepticism and poor reviews. I can say without exaggeration that what the people at RedHook have done with the game since then is a masterclass in developing an Early Access title, they listened thoroughly to player feedback and every change they made was absolutely spot on. This is a studio full of highly competent people who truly care about their game and respect your voice. With the amazing work they've done over the last year and a half I can't wait to see this game after another year or two of new content.

[b][Summary][/b]
Darkest Dungeon 2 is an outstanding tactical rougelite rpg that stays true to the spirit of its predecessor while having its own distinct identity, with gameplay that can make anyone lose track of time, a metric ton of variety and replayability, beautiful art and an immersive atmosphere unlike any other game out there. Whether you're a fan of tactical rpgs, roguelites, DD1 or you simply stumbled upon this review by accident, I can only recommend you give this game a try.",1
138131048,2086140,"How much value does the affirmation of some random review from some stranger have?

I don't know but I can vouch that this is a cool and active developer with cool gameplay.

Some issues in the current version exist such as slowdown and sound stacking but that's standard for this genre and will likely be improved upon in the future anyway.",1
138131488,1294810,"hey beat the game with the robot girl.  pretty bad game.  nothing even close to Prey as i was hoping.  i am shocked arkane released this with they name on it.  got the game free with my gfx card, i would never pay for this game.  you probably shouldnt either",0
138132010,1669000,"    I bought Age of Wonders: Planetfall years ago. Though I didn't spent much time in it, I considered it as an inspiring game with great potential. So I bought Age of Wonders 4 as soon as it was released and recommended my friend to do so, which has been the worst choice I've made this month (maybe this year). I felt guilty to have him waste money on a bunch of shit.
    Briefly speaking, I've spent around 7 hours in this game, which of course makes it hard to request a refund. But my actual play time is less than 50%, most of my time is wasted on rejoining a multiplayer game, waiting for others to battle with fucking goblins, and annoying so-called ""internal errors"". All these things made me extremely exhausted. I hate my competitive character, cause it forces me to struggle with terrible servers and stupid game features.
    I'm not among those deep gamers, but at least I'm willing to pay for those great games. If I could enjoy it, I don't care whether there is a discount or not. This game offers me with only pain instead of pleasure. I regret it now, I could have used the money to dine out, to buy my mother a hat, even to subscribe my favorite vtuber. But see what happens now: I sit in front of my screen in the most saddest position, drown in tremendous sorrow wondering if I'm fooled by the game makers. I'm a typical 21st century loser - cheated and wallet emptied by game companies.
    I hope to get my money back, even thought the time ruined by the game would never come back. This is the first time I fought back against those ghastly games. I may fail, but never surrender. As Ernest Miller Hemingway said, a man can be destroyed but not to beat.

138130911,2387950,"Fun retro style arcade action platformer. Reminds me of old licensed platformers that were loosely based on the source material, in a lighthearted way. I enjoy this take on Kalevala where Väinämöinen just beats the crap out of everyone.
I like the chaotic vibes, it's very fast paced. Music is nice too. Level and boss design is pretty lackluster, especially in later stages. The game gives you a bunch of fun tools for moving around but doesn't really utilise them (did you know you can jump on arrows to climb walls? Me neither!). It kinda gives the game an amateurish charm though, further enhancing the old school vibes.

Some complaints:
Why does money have invincibility frames when spawning AND flies all over the place? A lot of cash just flies off somewhere where you can't collect it and it's generally annoying to go fetch some coins that flew really far away.
Please let me rebind the keys for changing spells and weapons.

138130420,1494420,"Really fun game, the RTS features are great just lacking buildings and versatility when ingame. The only major issue is the AI pathing for the human resource gathering machine which needs regular micromanaging which makes it stressful.

138131734,1159690,"I truly dislike making a review this early into a game.  I know I haven't seen what this game has to offer yet.  I know I am, ultimately, reviewing an incomplete product.  The problem I have with the game, however, is that here, even nearly a dozen hours in, the game has been so mind-numbingly slow, monotonous, and boring, that I'm struggling to continue the game.  This review, in its current state, is more of a warning for that early game.  A majority of this review is going to be a copy/paste from a forum post I made seven hours in.  I will include further thoughts after.

The theme of this game is interesting, and I love interesting themes. But the actual gameplay for me, 7 hours in, has been boring. And I mean boring compared to other survival games. The resource gathering is painfully slow. You can't just go out and collect what you need, you need to wait for it to come within range. That takes the agency out of the players' hands, they are now beholden to the RNG gods and have to sit around until the right pieces they need come. Flooded to metal and can't find wood? Too bad, here's more metal, and more, and more over here. You have to wait, and if you don't see the wood hidden behind environmental stuff? Too bad, missed it, keep waiting.

Beyond that is the combat. Weapons in this game simply do not do enough damage, either outgoing or incoming. Combat becomes just a slog, especially when the game throws 8+ enemies at you. Each one takes forever to take down, but they can't kill you either. So it's just a slow, grindy, not fun process of poking at their heads when they're in cover.

And that combat only really happens (so far) in two places: Stops and outposts. And even then, only sometimes. But even without that, outposts are just mini-stops during the void, and neither one is really worth doing much in. There's some resources to be found at stops, sure, including plot specific stuff, but for the most part they are as devoid of actual content as the rest of the game. You'll find a few containers here and there with parts, some loose gear here and there - not enough to really make exploring worth while. There is the slot machine, if you found tokens, that doesn't really seem to be worth while. There is a vending machine you can use to try to buy parts you need with parts you're overflowing with - but never the right stuff (the above example, I have too much scrap metal, not enough wood, the cost of wood was in... chemicals, something else I was lacking).

There's also been no variety in these first seven hours. It's been the same void every time. Same outposts. Same stops. There's nothing new to see. Nothing new to do. Upgrades are drip-fed and trivial. The game just drags its feet. But more importantly, it's that lack of player agency and variety that really kills it. A slow start is OK if the player doesn't feel it. Here, it's in your face. It's the SAME components for seven hours, only recently did Zinc start getting added to the mix and I don't have enough wood to do anything anyway. The game needs variety, desperately. It needs the player to be able to do something to get more materials faster. Outposts have trees for crying out loud, why can't we harvest them for wood? Or break down buildings/containers etc. for scrap metal? SOMETHING to increase the resources, and something that lets the player be a part of it. Give more variety to the void, at least change the damned color once in a while. Let us feel like there's actual progress. This game feels like you're stuck in an unending mire. And that's a death knell for games like this. Perception is everything.

Yea, I'm only seven hours in, but these seven hours are turning me away from the game - something other survival games don't do. I suppose the best comparison this game has is The Raft, which I admit I have not played. Yet my friends who have have given that one glowing recommendations, and I can't do the same here.

Four hours later, things have only slightly changed.  I have finally gotten an ability to automatically gather some supplies.  This sounds like a wonderful thing, but it's not.  This will not replace the monotonous ""flying out in front of the train with the grappling hook looking for the parts I need"".  In fact, since you can't choose what supplies are automatically gathered, it tends to continue to unbalance you and give you the things that just clog your limited inventory rather than help you advance.  As a note, I've reached a second stage of materials, and crafting stations.  They don't replace the old ones, you still need the first tier stations in order to build all the first tier parts which you then upgrade on the second tier stations.  This does two things: Wastes more of your time, and wastes more of your fuel.  Especially as the second tier of stations require a higher grade of fuel to function.  Which you can either waste even more resources trying to convert your current supplies into higher tier stuff - at rather diminishing returns for the fuel it takes to DO that - or you're once again beholden to the RNG for the fuel you need to appear in the void.

As a note, one thing I don't have yet is the ability to make any walls for the train.  Or add any decor.  Which the, let's call them ""crew members"" you do receive later require for increased happiness in order to unlock their abilities.  I am still stuck with a long line of flat beds.  Which creates a second problem.  In most crafting games, you can design a layout that expands in at least two dimensions, so that you can at least somewhat mitigate the travel time between sections.  Being stuck on a train, all it ever does it get longer, making parts of the train further and further apart as you progress.  Literally, in the case where you expand a current car rather than make a new one.  Which is another set of oddness, as you're limited to the number of sections you can build, and a new car or expanding a current one both take up one section - and the same components.  I find that confusing and unnecessary as well.  It'd be better to limit the number of cars, but independently be able to upgrade them.  Or perhaps that would be too predictable.

Finally, speed.  The rate in which you can travel through the void is extremely limited, by design.  Even if you get a faster engine, there are obstacles that demand that you travel slowly.  Not only are there the outposts that stop your train cold (supposedly, you can ram them - but it will damage your train doing so), there is a far worse threat out there.  Two flavors of mines.  One is activated entirely on your speed.  If you try to move quickly through them, they explode and will destroy your engine, leaving you stranded until you can repair it.  Hope this doesn't happen when you're out of supplies!  Second are just magnetic mines, that don't care what speed you're going.  They just latch on to the train and then explode.  Now, both sets of mines can be dealt with in a few ways: Destroying them from a distance, or disarming them up close.  But the faster you're going, the harder they are to do with, and the more of them there are.  If you are moving at a decent pace and come across a mine field, you have almost no time to react before your engine is torn to pieces and you're stuck.  The only solution is to crawl through the void at the slowest default speed.  (That saves on precious fuel as well - the same fuel that you need for all the crafting.)

The early game is not balanced.  At all.  It is an absolute grind that even veteran survival game players will find themselves struggling with.  You have no agency, you simply have to wait for materials to come to you, slowly.  The environments early on lack the promise of variety that the trailer shows.  It's all the same void until, supposedly, you earn something new.

138132083,758690,"This game has been called unplayable and a mess, and I am still trying to find out what justifies that. I have been following this work of art from the beginning along with many others. I will start off by saying I am a proud backer of the Kickstarter that brought us this game. There are some things that need worked on with the game, but I just played it for 5 hours and thoroughly enjoyed it. As long as you're not trying to play the game on a potato of a computer, everything ran fine for me and looked great on Medium graphics settings with the resolution set for 1900x1080. Everything still looked great, GPU was never used up over 70%. I run a Nvidia 3060 12gb VRAM. CPU never went over 10%. I run a Intel i7 12700k 3.6GHz 12-Core Processor. A majority of these people claiming to have all these issues most likely don't have the settings configured properly. Anyone who is a fan of the survival genre, LOOK NO FURTHER! This game has it all, and instead of having to worry about annoying A.I. Wolves, Bears, or other creatures. You simply have to survive the harsh elements of Mars. I absolutely love that the devs of this game worked hand in hand with the folks developing tools/structures for colonies on the Moon/Mars in the here and now. The structures you see in game are the prototypes of what they may be using in future colonization missions in space. What a time to be alive! You can expect the normal grind you would have to put in when playing a solid survival game. You have the same frustrations as well, however, this game is Early Access and I would have to say it is probably one of the better Early Access titles I have played that hasn't been a complete flop.

138133947,1623940,"I sometimes wish there was some sort of mid tier for reviews, the game looks stunning, creature design is really neat, the stories and mood are interesting and the music is pretty and atmospheric. I also liked how brutal it could be as weird as that sounds lol. But This feels all dragged down by the actual gameplay, it feels quite clunky and stiff. It very much looked like a game I should play with a controller but I noticed that at certain points the controller just did not work or respond. Buttons to interact with items would disappear forcing me to restart sometimes (I noticed there is a softlock patch out rn, this might have fixed the issue I was having), left or right control stick would not work but only when I was climbing on cages for some reason. Just a few odd bugs here and there causing me to switch from controller to kbm at random points. 

Those problems aside, the gameplay generally is not very deep and it doesn't need to be but it does help when it at least feels good/smooth. Which it did not. Puzzles feel very resident evil-y, very basic and not sure if they even add anything to the experience aside from more playtime (Which is not a lot). I even found myself overthinking them quite a lot but it was always the most simple solution. The game is also weird about its own rules sometimes, mostly when it comes to water. Usually going into the water means death but there were times where the character could swim or the water was just undeep but you are unable to see if it is or not. 

Overall, beautiful game, would simply not rec because of the gameplay, short playtime combined with the pricepoint. If you care less about that it's a great experience and the dev is worth keeping an eye on.",0

This does have more lightsaber bosses compared to the first one which is great, speaking of the first game, you could dodge cancel attacks in fallen order, I cant see why you cant in survivor, the stances (especially crossgaurd) suffer from not being able to dodge cancel attacks, it would only improve the combat making it even more fast paced, speaking of improving the already great combat, lightsaber stances, just let me cycle through all stances on the fly, it would give a Dante from DMC type of feel to it, just map left on the d pad as ""switch stances"" and right on the d pad as ""sheathe and unsheathe"", its that simple, mods already do it, you know what else mods did? added DLSS which DOUBLED the FPS!

138134181,1669000,"This game is best compared to Total War: Warhammer wherein every faction is customizable, even more so as the game progresses. This is great! But, where it lags behind TW at present is unfortunately the turn based combat. Those dramatic combat moments should be the times where all the choices you have made up to this point come back to either delight or haunt you with perceptible consequences on the game board, i.e. in the blood and sweat of deadly combat between warring peoples.

The hex battle board itself is often gloriously illustrated while the environmental obstacles and interactions are quite engaging. The character models are uninspired, their animations are stilted and stiff, and their impact on the field of battle is lacking. The whole combat scheme is almost surely a port from a mobile game that was abandoned at some point and adapted for this project. All that said however, I really only have to point to the 'cinematic' slow-mo shots at the end of battles as the epitome of the game's flaws: unimpactful, underwhelming and un-wonderful.

I would have loved an open RTS-style battlescape with command of units, monsters and artillery interacting in a fully immersive environment subject to the choices the player made on the over world. I guess I'll take the turn-based hex board in a pinch. I don't think asking for the former is too much from a studio like Paradox, but it seems like they already made the lesser choice in hindsight.",0

138134395,1494420,"Loads of potential really enjoying it, Looks awesome.",1
138134374,1494420,"Great Idea for a game and for the most part well done however as many reviews put it there are problems.

Mostly with path finding; most obvious with the human harvesters which are too big for the rough terrain to properly navigate.

Alien faction is a great experience for the commander but because it relies on numbers to get anything done the game will always crash, as for fps players in the alien faction you are just a single drone in a swarm and once you die (inevitably) you are respawned at the nearest nest (usually the only one) with no hope of joining back into the zerg rush that is occuring.

Crabs. The weakest enemy in the game yet will reliably be capable of killing human harvesters and super tanks, either by climbing ontop of them with no actual way to get them off the harvest or hiding under the belly of the tank in a small ravine leaving it difficult to attack them. (AI human tanks are useless as they cant disembark to clear the tank of threats.)

As most reviews put it a good alien commander will be capable of outperforming an equal human commander usually due to the human economy being crippled by harvester pathfinding. At best the game will either end mid game with the aliens zerging with their heaviest units, late game with humans doing the same with their units if its a particularly large open map or most common the server crashes because the alien commander has around 300 of their harvester type unit farming away on all the different nodes.",1

138135811,1940340,"Do not go into this game thinking it's DD1. Instead of a 60-80hr long campaign, you'll have 3-5hr runs in a roguelite format.

This roguelite style suits me more as I generally have less patience for longer campaigns, however, if a longer campaign is what you prefer then you'll most likely be disappointed.

I would still give it a go, the game is aesthetically beautiful, as was DD1, the gameplay is just as brutal, unforgiving but just as satisfying and relieving when you overcome all the obstacles. The barks, the wayne lines, the good and bad RNG, the stress both in game, and out of game that comes with it, it's still Darkest Dungeon to its core, but at the end of the day it is NOT DD1 in terms of its style of 'campaign', so please keep that in mind, if you are dubious, watch a few videos first to see if you think you'd enjoy it.

The maps are interesting, the boss challenging and the progression is interesting with you gaining a currency to spend on whatever you want to deblock, should it be bonuses for a specific class or new items to play with. And so far it has nothhing to do with Darkest Dungeon.
Everything that I liked in the first game has been removed, your heroes just feel like replaceable puppet as you invest in their class, not them. You don't lose as much when they die. Stress also doesn't feel as important as the 1st game. The roads also don't feel as interesting as the dungeons, and it feels like there's less to do between ""rooms"" as before.
Overall it just feel like an easier and dumbed down version of the 1st. Which I guess is fine in a way, but as it's titled like a sequel, it just feel like a disapointment.",0

138136181,1159690,"I have enjoyed this game so far. It does need some polishing, but is early access. Some of the menus could be better in the crafting menu / take less time to open. Your hammer spinning the firs time was cool but now its annoying because the animation takes too long. 

I was expecting RAFT with trains in the void, and that is kind of what I got albeit in an early stage. 

Art style is very cool. I see this as a game I will play a lot of and look forward to the updates it will be getting!",1
138135950,1159690,"Some things that detract from the experience of the early access steam launch imo (Aside from bugs and lack of content)...

• Using the quick return to train whilst floating in the void pulls you into awkward positions and feels poorly implemented.

• Not a fan of the time it takes to switch between the building mode and hammer.

• I don't feel like cabin walls protect what's inside them well enough from mines. Most people I assume will want storage by the engine in the front most cabin for fuel storage etc and this area seems to get hit the hardest by mines. The price of being hit can = having to repair multiple weak parts that break like floors, lighting, storage, furniture etc and this can be tedious especially given the resource cost. I'd add some sort of extra layer of protection against this for players later in the game so that it doesn't out stay itself in the game play loop for too long as it's not my idea of fun repeatable content after a certain point. I think it only suits the earlier stages of the game when setting up as you're generally more interested in looking around the void where you'll spot them and for what it is, it's a more engaging encounter as you're learning how to manage the train.

• A portion of the collectables floating in the void will glide by the train just out of reach of the grapple hook when standing at the edge of your train platform. It's fine that some of the spawns are far enough away that they require you to get closer to them by going into the void yourself but something about the ones that you barely can't reach by a fraction just feels odd. I'd change those particular spawn coordinates to be slightly closer making it feel more intuitive to the player whether they can collect something from the train or whether they'll need to jump further out.

• The glowing destructible rocks in the void are underwhelming and they need something in them that feels more rewarding to collect.

• Prophecies aren't interesting or impactful and feel underwhelming.

• When pulling into a gate station you suddenly lose access to a portion of the available walk space in your train for a period of time. The sudden darkness during the transition looks odd and the whole sequence generally feels poorly implemented.


Anyway I really like the game, thanks devs.",1
138135921,1159690,"I love it so far and love the whole train idea in comparison to raft. Only real downside is collecting can be slow but at least it can be kind of automated later on. Excited to see what will be added.


Also there is no connecting to and Epic account idk what some people are talking about.",1
138134760,1159690,"I've been anticipating this game since it was announced about a year ago. I love the game so far, but I can see why people might not like it. The game is still in early access and I would highly recommend people treat it as such (also highly recommend playing the demo).

The game looks and feels great, the combat is a bit odd but I like what the game has to offer so far. I'm exited to see the game improve and expand.",1
138134308,1159690,"Like most, probably, I'd compare this game style to be closest to Raft. The difference being you have guns, you're on a train flying through hyperspace, there's a narrator keeping you company, and you aren't dying of starvation for not eating a potato every 35 seconds. I'm a big fan of games with clear progression paths giving you something to work towards, and so far, 13 hours in, it has yet to disappoint.",1

138136023,758690,I enjoyed this when I did the pre-release play test it and I bought it and I enjoy it now. It does have issues here and there but nothing game breaking that I have encountered. And the Devs are actively slinging out patches daily and that may slow down some once they get it in a better state but at least they are trying which is more than I can say for most other EA titles. Those that are saying it is unplayable are just using it as an excuse to crap on it. Patience and understanding seem to be lacking in today's society.,1
138135409,758690,"I don't know why so many negative reviews, although I have not played the prologue in campaign I have played 9 hours on Free play and I am enjoying it a lot, sure it has some bugs as to be expected however they are not game breaking.
I expected to enjoy this game prior to launch and I am enjoying it even more than I thought I would, my only criticism at this time is performance related, I am only getting around 35 fps on medium settings and would like the game to be more optimised...
",1
138133921,1681840,"First and foremost, I have to admit up front, I play Abalon mostly on my Android tablet. So why am I posting a review here? Because the device the game is played on is irrelevant to the game's enjoyment (which speaks volumes as to the game's planning). I have been playing D20 games since they published Hero Mages and was eager for an update. When I wrote the developer, not only did they update Hero Mages, but they also told me about Abalon (called Summoners Fate then). I immediately became a backer and have not regretted this decision for a moment. Helping shape the game (some of my suggestions are featured in the game, like fast-travel in map overview, to name one) is every player's dream.

What makes D20 games so appealing to me? As usual with this sort of thing, it is very difficult to quantify an experience - a feeling. Like many genres of entertainment, not all titles have the ""X"" factor for everyone, but certain titles have a broader appeal than others. IMHO, Abalon is one of them. Abalon has that X-factor that covers many age groups, genres, and cultures. It takes planning and brain power to beat it, not finger dexterity and/or in app purchases. You cannot buy your way out of bad situations, but you can reason your way out.

Abalon is also very replayable. As it is a deck building game as well, you need experience and strategy to come up with a good deck that works for you. To accomplish this simple yet pivotal task, you do need to farm for cards, but that is far from a chore and more like a mini-game. There are many layers to Abalon, so you should try it. Playing it is the only way to appreciate the true mastery that is a very well written, very entertaining game.",1
138097892,1681840,"First impressions are good:
https://youtu.be/uUqkE5taN_8",1
137865803,1681840,Addictive gameplay loop!,1
118116202,1681840,"First of all don't be scared off by the looks and name of this game!
I know for me those two things scream low efford, pay to win mobile game, but it's far from that!

Evenso the game comes of as quite simple, and many ways it is which makes it quite accessable, it still holds a supprising amount of depth!

Positioning, order of attacks and using environmental hazards to your advantage make a huge difference in a fight. Because you can only use so many cards in your deck (20 + the cards you find on the way between rest) you are encouraged to not just vomit every creature and spell onto the board because it's in your hand and you got the mana for it as each card used goes to a kind of discard pile which only gets shuffled back into your deck once you spend resources to camp.

You can pick different Summoners at the start of an adventure (they are basically your hero if they die you lose), each of them have different affinities which dictates what faction cards they can use and each one has some kind of special ability, the most notable one is the strting character druid which hurls 1/1 squirrels at enemies what great fun! Down the line you can pick up 4 cost creatures which can function as soemthing that's called Guardians, minions that follow your hero and are always summoned (unless killed in which case you get to revive them the next tiem you camp). You can have a maximum of 2 guardians with you but you can collect more of them in the course of an adventure even if you can only use 2 of them at a time. Note that these guardians keep their health damage between fights (same with your summoner hero).

There are a couple more mechanics like loyal minions, satchel cards and the random encounter d20 dice system but I will let you discover those on your own.

I personally highly reccomand this game, it's already quite fun and it's not even finished yet with new conntent being added regularly!",1
118013846,1681840,"The game is... OK. It's a decent idea, decently implemented, but there are big balance issues.

The game is, by no stretch of the imagination, a deckbuilder. 3 cards from a deck of 20, drawing only when cards are used, leaves you entirely at the mercy of variance, with little to no chance of drawing synergistic cards.

Normal encounters are trivially easy. Many can be beaten without playing a single card, the others can usually be beaten with a single card. Elite encounters, on the other hand, are often impossible unless you draw exactly the cards you need or have good Guardians with you - which is essentially random as it depends on the order you explore the map.

Boss encounters are much easier than Elites.

There are also terrible issues with the tactical game and controls. Some units can make a ranged attack after moving, but you get no indication as to whether the move you have chosen will lead them to do so (at least with AOE attacks - single target is better), you're just left guessing. You get no chance to set your units up before a battle - they just wander into the new (unseen) area and stand where they like, meaning you often start a fight with your units blocking each other. That's really poor design for a TRPG.",0
118008912,1681840,The game is absolutely fantastic! It's a mix between real-time exploration and turn based combat. I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys deck-building games combined with a DnD feeling of exploration. I'm looking forward to see how development goes and hopefully there a lot more content on the way!,1
117855209,1681840,"Summoners Fate is great! I first found this game at Pax Prime 2021 and it was easily my favorite discovery of the year. Told the dev I couldnt wait to play more. It was clear to me that there was a clear strategic depth to the game play and that multiplayer duels were being considered in the design. Everything felt like it was both strong and had counters if you leaned too heavy on one thing. So I immediately bought the beta and my wife and I played it heaps. 

Now the game has launched into early access and with the addition of achievements and unlocks my wife and I are diving back in. You should buy this game if you are looking for a strategic roguelike single player experience, or a competitive nnd fun multiplayer experience. I can't speak too much for what the online multiplayer is like with strangers, anytime I've played with against another person it's been my wife.

If you watch some game play and you even think it's up your alley you owe it to yourself to check it out!",1
117835440,1681840,"I could almost rebuild my Squirrels combo Magic the Gathering deck, how cool is that??? :)
Love this game!",1
117816864,1681840,"Summoners Fate is great!  So much fun, so smooth and enjoyable.  It's like a mix of Hearthstone (spells, minions) and Final Fantasy Tactics (minions are on a battle map rather than just in a line of minions).  And the roguelike exploration is really enjoyable too.  
",1
117779368,1681840,"An interesting take on a deckbuilding turn-based tactics game.
Unlike other roguelike deckbuilders you don't automatically redraw your deck once you run out of cards, this only happens once you take a rest on a special campsite which you can find between encounters.
Since the amount of campsites is limited a player would probably find it reasonable to try to squeeze the maximum value out of their cards, however the game does a pretty good job of punishing playstyles that get too greedy, dying comes easy in this adventure.
Some of the early issues were promptly addressed by the developer so I am pretty excited to see what the future holds for this project.
Overall the management of ressources and risks is fun, the tactics part is decent and the game has enough content to keep repeatable playthroughs ""fresh"" despite being in early access.
An easy recommendation.",1
117760940,1681840,"Many developers have tried the ""Magic the Gathering crossed with turn-based tactics"" formula before--but in my opinion, few have nailed it as successfully as D20 Studios has with Summoners Fate. 

Now, full disclaimer: I haven't tried multiplayer mode yet, and I'm not especially interested in multiplayer. Rather, SF has a single-player roguelite ""Adventure"" mode--that is what I've been spending my time on so far, and that is what I'm here to review. Adventure mode is simply really, really solid. Featuring a good mix of exploration, proc gen battles, random events, resource management, and even light environmental storytelling of the ""collect pieces of a scattered journal"" variety, Adventure mode really elevates Summoners Fate above similar games like Faeria. It scratches an itch I haven't felt scratched since Shandalar--and if you're old enough to know what I'm talking about with Shandalar, then just do yourself a favor and buy this.",1
117754028,1681840,"Someone else said it's a combo of Legend of Zelda, Magic: The Gathering, and D&D.

I couldn't imagine how that can be a coherent game, but the description is spot-on and it's a perfect blend.",1
117753229,1681840,"Summoners Fate is a really fun deck-building game that is less about building a fine tuned deck and more about making the best out of what you find. Cards being discarded until resting creates a refreshing change of pace from regular deck building games. Instead of trimming and fine tuning your deck, you collect cards throughout your time playing that you can continue to use between rests to prolong your power which gives all card drops value. You then rest and fine tuning your best deck for harder fights to give you best odds at advancing.

One of the most important things to note is how responsive and friendly D20Studios has been in the discussions and discord. They listen to players, share their thoughts on how things have been implemented and actively seek to change and evolve the game to what players want. Wonderful Developer and a really fun game!",1
127611055,2136470,"I AM ASTROCHRONIC.

I like trout. 

I also like this game.  It is full of jank.  Like the Trout in Lake Michigan.  Good jank, though.  Proof of concept jank.  Not like the Trout in Lake Michigan.  Buy it while it is still full of janky goodness.  It janked me hard and I hardly janked it but when it janks my janker I get all jankish in the jankles. 
HAS A DASH.  A janky dash.  LOOK AT IT'S GLORIOUS JANKAGE!

138137303,2379620,"Fun little free game that takes approx 10-20 minutes. A storyless short game with souls like combat that takes you straight to a boss fight, which if you win you've already beaten the game. The controls are a bit rough and there's no options to change anything, even the Y axis. I played this on the steam deck and it actually works perfectly. Furthermore you can change the stick settings in the Decks control menu. If you pause the game you're taken to the main menu where you'll have to restart the game, so there's no breaks during an attempt. 5 cheevos in all, all easy except for one which requires a no hit run. Despite the games minimal design and rough edges if think I'll be back to attemp that no hit run. In all, not much to this game but worth a quick go.",1

[b]Fair Warning! This Review May Contain Spoilers for Both Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (2019) and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (2023)![/b]

I am a huge Star Wars fan, I have watched every major film, animated show, live action show excluding Andor (2022) and Star Wars: Resistance (2018). I have also played quite a few Star Wars games in my life from classics such as Star Wars: Battlefront (2004), Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005), and Star Wars: Republic Commando (2005). To current games like EA’s Star Wars Battlefront II (2017), Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (2019), and now Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (2023). So you could say I have been a fan of Galaxy Far Far Away, for a Long Long Time. 


Now into the main review. I recently purchased the game on Steam just two days before its release, as I was quite excited for the sequel. The game ran poorly on my PC, now this may be due to my system just not fitting the right requirements for the game, but I have heard that other PC users have also experienced frame loss, loss of textures, etc. 
So I rebought the game on my PS5 and played the game in full there. Now with the mix of the time I put into both platforms I have pretty much thirty hours of game time played. Six of the thirty hours would be counted as already playing the same parts for a while. The game’s story is said to be thirty hours long. I played on the base difficulty the game throws at you from the get go being Jedi Knight of five optional difficulties being Story Mode, Jedi Padawan, Jedi Knight, Jedi Master, and Jedi Grand Master. 

On my PS5 after finishing the story it said I had twenty-four hours of playtime in total. Which means that it took me twenty-three hours at most to do the story, as I spent nearly a whole hour trying to kill the horrid boss Spawn Of Oggdo. Yes Oggdo Boggdo’s Son (as the name implies) makes an appearance into the game, as is quite a difficult and annoying boss to fight for those who aren’t yet mastered in the lightsaber arts. Like me… 

The story is great, absolutely is just *chef’s kiss* of a story, from returning characters such as Greeze, Merrin, and Cere, to newly appearing characters like Dagan Gera, Bode, Monk, Caij, and more! 

The first game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order had eight locations in the game that the player was introduced / got to go to, that list being (in order of story) Bracca, Bogano, Zeffo, Kashyyk, Ordo Eris, Dathomir, Ilum, and Nur. Mind you that the main locations that are more explorable with actual things to find are Bogano, Zeffo, Kashyyyk, Dathomir, and Ilum. Whereas Bracca, Ordo Eris, and Nur are mainly tied to storytelling with no real freedom for the player to explore as these locations are linear. Now one thing that was certainly fun was being a Jedi surviving as best as possible while still getting to explore more of the galaxy. One thing that more people like me wished was to have even more to explore with these locations, and even to return to some like Bracca which is the scrapyard planet of the Galaxy, as it was introduced in the game that Cal Kestis the Jedi you portray as in the first installment has been hiding out on Bracca helping breaking down the various ships, tanks, and other military vehicles from both sides of The Clone Wars. How fun would it be to have Cal need to return there for something that ties into his quest. 
However, we only get six locations in the sequel and unlike Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order all locations are only accessible in a specific order of importance to the plot. Whereas in the first installment you had the option to go to Dathomir as soon as you got to Bogano and were ready to head back out into the galaxy. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor’s locations are Coruscant, Koboh, Jedha, Shattered Moon (The Shattered Moon of Koboh), Nova Garon, and Tanalorr. Just as the predecessor, not all locations are explorable, meaning as really only Tanalorr the endgame location isn’t really anything special, considering its importance to the plot, especially for the type of planet it is. As once you reach the final mission on Tanalorr and complete it you can look back at the holomap and see that Tanalorr is probably going to be the first location for everyone to fully explore as there are no collectibles, secrets, or fun things to do as it is only designed for the final quest. 

Speaking of the fact we are two locations less of what the predecessor has, it seems that a reason for that might be because of just how big and explorable Koboh and Jedha really are. It is quite funny to think that Coruscant, the planet-wide city that delves several levels below its top city layer, is actually smaller in exploration than planets like Koboh or the desert planet of Jedha. Some of you who have not gotten to play the game yet or are still having just that small difficulty of connecting on where you remember Jedha from, Jedha was introduced in the film Star Wars: Rogue One (2016), you know the planet that has Saw Gerrera, where we got to meet Chirrut, Baze, and the Imperial Pilot Bohdi. 

I do find it quite upsetting that there aren’t as many locations you can go to and that Koboh and Jedha are the only two that have the most exploration out of all six that have any exploration at all. Regardless of this there are a variety of things you can do in the whole of exploration, lots of collecting to do. From collecting four different types of things for vendors, where you can purchase a variety of perks, cosmetics for Cal’s clothes and weaponry, or even BD-1. You can also collect fish and seeds for a garden. No you don’t get to go fishing yourself, but you get to meet a hearty fisherman named Skooba Stev who tells you his woes and fascinating tales of fishing! 

While on the planet of Koboh your main goal is to get to Greeze’s Cantina Pyloon’s Saloon, named after Greeze’s Great Grandmother which will be the main base for Cal and the gang. Which is where it will house the variety of other characters you can meet along the way and tell them to head to the Saloon. Koboh is not only the second planet you venture to, but also offers some familiar face plates. Yes the Separatists are on Koboh, you get to run into B1 Battle Droids, B2 Super Battle Droids, Droidekas, Magna Guards, and Commando Droids. As they have been reprogrammed to work for the local raider group the Bedlam Raiders. 

Now the story is fantastic, so fantastic I don’t want to give off too many spoilers, especially big moments. A quick summary of the plot is that it has to do with some ancient two century old technology from the High Republic days dealing with a secret. But all in all the story had me laughing, crying, scared, and hot headed. As it does have a variety of ups and downs. 

In conclusion Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (2023) is a fantastic sequel, and is a recommended play for anyone who wishes to delve back into the boots of Jedi Knight Cal Kestis. I rate it a good 8/10 for a variety of great reasons, and in this review you can see some of why I love it and why I dislike some aspects. Of course if I were to list even more this review will continue on for a longer time, but that is okay. Because it is not to the point that makes the game unplayable.",1

Now one thing that was certainly fun was being a Jedi surviving as best as possible while still getting to explore more of the galaxy. One thing that more people like me wished was to have even more to explore with these locations, and even to return to some like Bracca which is the scrapyard planet of the Galaxy, as it was introduced in the game that Cal Kestis the Jedi you portray as in the first installment has been hiding out on Bracca helping breaking down the various ships, tanks, and other military vehicles from both sides of The Clone Wars. How fun would it be to have Cal need to return there for something that ties into his quest. 
However, we only get six locations in the sequel and unlike Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order all locations are only accessible in a specific order of importance to the plot. Whereas in the first installment you had the option to go to Dathomir as soon as you got to Bogano and were ready to head back out into the galaxy. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor’s locations are Coruscant, Koboh, Jedha, Shattered Moon (The Shattered Moon of Koboh), Nova Garon, and Tanalorr. Just as the predecessor, not all locations are explorable, meaning as really only Tanalorr the endgame location isn’t really anything special, considering its importance to the plot, especially for the type of planet it is. As once you reach the final mission on Tanalorr and complete it you can look back at the holomap and see that Tanalorr is probably going to be the first location for everyone to fully explore as there are no collectibles, secrets, or fun things to do as it is only designed for the final quest. 

Speaking of the fact we are two locations less of what the predecessor has, it seems that a reason for that might be because of just how big and explorable Koboh and Jedha really are. It is quite funny to think that Coruscant, the planet-wide city that delves several levels below its top city layer, is actually smaller in exploration than planets like Koboh or the desert planet of Jedha. Some of you who have not gotten to play the game yet or are still having just that small difficulty of connecting on where you remember Jedha from, Jedha was introduced in the film Star Wars: Rogue One (2016), you know the planet that has Saw Gerrera, where we got to meet Chirrut, Baze, and the Imperial Pilot Bohdi. 

I do find it quite upsetting that there aren’t as many locations you can go to and that Koboh and Jedha are the only two that have the most exploration out of all six that have any exploration at all. Regardless of this there are a variety of things you can do in the whole of exploration, lots of collecting to do. From collecting four different types of things for vendors, where you can purchase a variety of perks, cosmetics for Cal’s clothes and weaponry, or even BD-1. You can also collect fish and seeds for a garden. No you don’t get to go fishing yourself, but you get to meet a hearty fisherman named Skooba Stev who tells you his woes and fascinating tales of fishing! 

While on the planet of Koboh your main goal is to get to Greeze’s Cantina Pyloon’s Saloon, named after Greeze’s Great Grandmother which will be the main base for Cal and the gang. Which is where it will house the variety of other characters you can meet along the way and tell them to head to the Saloon. Koboh is not only the second planet you venture to, but also offers some familiar face plates. Yes the Separatists are on Koboh, you get to run into B1 Battle Droids, B2 Super Battle Droids, Droidekas, Magna Guards, and Commando Droids. As they have been reprogrammed to work for the local raider group the Bedlam Raiders. 

Now the story is fantastic, so fantastic I don’t want to give off too many spoilers, especially big moments. A quick summary of the plot is that it has to do with some ancient two century old technology from the High Republic days dealing with a secret. But all in all the story had me laughing, crying, scared, and hot headed. As it does have a variety of ups and downs. 

In conclusion Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (2023) is a fantastic sequel, and is a recommended play for anyone who wishes to delve back into the boots of Jedi Knight Cal Kestis. I rate it a good 8/10 for a variety of great reasons, and in this review you can see some of why I love it and why I dislike some aspects. Of course if I were to list even more this review will continue on for a longer time, but that is okay. Because it is not to the point that makes the game unplayable.",1

138138320,1494420,"In its current state the game is not worth 20€, i was thinking about refunding it, but for now i wont. I will keep the title for a while without playing it just looking at what the developer will do with the game. And if my suspicion that this game is a scam will be confirmed i will refund.
This Early Access release is one of those perfect examples for everything wrong with Early Access titles.
This is more of a Tech Demo showing off the possible concepts of the game. 
The Visuals are quite good, the sound design is also very good. I liked the Intro cinematic. 
But the Intro cinematic looks like it was done by making a few pictures with a image generating AI and then putting a voice over on top of it, a work of a few hours.
The game consist of two parts The FPS and the RTS part, they are supposed to be intertwined but they sort of arent. 
As a Soldier in the FPS mode my gameplay consisted mostly of running around the map, like a walking simulator, exploring an empty map with nothing to interact in it, only having a primary weapon and thats it. I was a soldier and all i got was a rifle, no secondary weapon, no grenade, no special ability, no walki talkie to request some air strike from my commander, no ability to maybe harvest some additional minerals for my faction, or maybe capture some point of interest, or even sabotage some of the enemy buildings, i could not assasinate enemy commander because he isnt even present on the battlefield.
none of those things that for me would be obvious features of a game that tries to combine FPS/RTS are in the game.
the fps part of it is more of a horde shooter with access to vehicles which your commander can provide if he so chooses.
and the RTS part is simply not very good, there is no real strategy in the game. What makes a RTS is choices,
different upgrade paths for your army, choices whether to build more economy or more army, choices whether to research the heavy tank, or maybe the light artillery, choices how to spend the resources. whether it will be on research, more army, maybe more defenses. none of this is in the game.
research is linear, its simply upgrade your faction to the next tier unlocking more units which are simply stronger. buildings are built simultaneosly so for me there was no real choice whether to build that one or the other building, i simply built all... and won the game by simply swarming my enemy with tons of troops having ridiculous income from building refineries all the time, 
the RTS has no depth and requires no strategy. like i already mentioned in the FPS part there are no ways to actually influence the outcome of battles by maybe sending some air strikes, helping your team with the defence by building defensive structures, also no way to take controll of the units and actually join the battle. cant assign units into squads and make them follow a particular player. 
simply nothing the game is a worse command and conquer. worse in every way.
To summarize, FPS part is hold down shift W to sprint in the hope that you get to leftclick at some point. Press space to jump because boredom... RTS part is spam buildings/units and hope for enemy commander to be more bored falling asleep and spamming less buildings/units. No strategy/tactics required.
That is not a game, simply no gameplay, and no gameplay idea from the dev.
My fear about this game is that it simply tries to cash in on all those players who want a game which combines first person battle and RTS like mount and blade, or maybe executive command. that it will never be good and will simply become abandoned.
that is why i am giving this game a big thumbs down, don't fall for it, for now, wait, maybe this will become good, i will definitely change my review then.",0
138138208,2337630,"I want a great AFL game and it feels like we always take 1 step forward and 10 steps back. Like others have said, I cannot recommend it in its current form. It's getting better daily and might change to recommended it as its updated.

Pros:
- Graphics, easily the best graphics of any AFL game ever released.
- Set shot goal kicking is decent with unique animations for star players.
- The AI is more competitive than previous games.
- Individual players' stats really matter, e.g. a bull is harder to tackle and can dispose whilst being tackled. 
- Every stadium is in the game and highly detailed.
- AFLW included.

Cons:
- Crashes to desktop occasionally, in-house game engine buggy as hell.
- No bumping in the game.
- No speccies, even though they were in the trailer.
- No 50m penalties, even though players often run through the mark.
- No Anzac day guernseys for the two clubs that play on the day, yet other clubs have them?
- No national anthem on Anzac day or finals.
- Cutscenes get repetitive with no variety, same half-time cutscene every game with different players/team.
- No highlights of the game at halftime or end of game.
- Only 1 control scheme with no button mapping option.
- There's only 1 model of player in rookie draft, a guy with a bald head, you can recruit players aged 10 years old.
- Commentary is average, Gary Lyon has awful analysis after every boundary throw in, should have brought in Brian Taylor, or someone with passion and good one-liners.
- Can't move the player on the mark, no outside 5 rule, or option to not man the mark.
- Players feel like they on rails and snap to tackles or spoils from far away.
- Create a player is very generic with only presets available and no sliders. Cannot create a past player to any resemblance.",0

138139147,1159690,"Short version:
Lots of potential, room to grow
Price too high, very little to show

Long version:
Big fan of the genre, this game has a lot of potential. If you enjoyed Raft you will likely enjoy this, but keep in mind it is not in a finished state and has very little to actually 'explore'. You will be slowly grinding your way through the current tech tree, which offers you very little in the way of interesting early items or equipment to experiment with.

I enjoyed my time with it so far and will continue playing for now, but the pace of the game is hard to manage. It is too easy to take it slow and methodical and get bored with this self-inflicted slow progression cycle. Most of my time I have either been crawling along at minimum speed to collect resources, or stopped entirely to craft/research. POIs at stopping points are all very similar and you are not penalised in any way for dying. You are actually rewarded by respawning with max food and health, and all items dropped are marked where you died (which is usually less than 30 seconds away). The trailer is showing you things you will absolutely not experience by 'Gate 12'. If you are interested in trying this game out, try playing through to gate 12 and then re-watching the trailer. 

Two suggestions that would immediately improve the game for me:

1. Give the player an incentive to keep the train moving the majority of the time. A threat that follows at half minimum speed along the track would work fine, or even not allowing the player to brake at all until much later on. The player is encouraged far too much to collect resources when there are no active threats to discourage this slowing-down of gameplay.

2. Streamline the weapon part drops/management. It was very clunky and I found myself completely disengaging with the parts/weapons and just using the basic revolver exclusively. Even having a separate inventory section with much larger storage just for weapon parts would go a long way. 

This game is very promising, but the current pace and content does not justify the price or 'epic' trailer. You will have a very different experience. For reference, at the time of writing, RAFT is £14.99 in a completely finished state and full of content. This is £24.99 and likely needs another year or more to be even closely comparable. 

This price point for the current content is the deciding factor for me. Far too high for the current state it is in. For £10-15 this would be a pretty easy recommend, but this is another one of those early access games where you're paying for promises and not the current experience. Maybe it will reach its potential and be worth it, maybe not. For most players today this kind of price point simply isn't worth the risk. 

If you don't mind paying for promises and taking a leap of faith to support a novel game in the genre, go for it. It worked out for me with Raft, Astroneer, The Forest, Green Hell, and many more, but if you are cautious about spending and want to be sure of the product you're buying, wait for full release and see if it gets discounted further. 

When the game is fully released I will update this review to reflect any changes.",0

Yes the campaing needs a lot (a lot lot) tuning and polishing. I did abandon the campaing at the escape from the base part, because of it's frustrating elements.

When i moved onto the free play mode, i got what i expected.

Yes, the pace of the game is slow. Can be meditative at some points, but the demo showed what to expect, so no dissapointments there.
Yes, the graphics are not Unreal Engine 5 level, but a big thumbs up for the creators in making all the buildings, tools, mechanical parts, connectors, cables, etc as lifelike as possible!
Yes, it has bugs, but nothing that couldn't be handled in the future!

This is an Early Access. It is meant to be available for purchase for the players who are willing to give money to the developers knowing that the game is still a work in progress. Supporting them so to speak. This is what early access is for. Not to troll and cancel them and request money back after 15 minutes of play...

138140779,1869590,"FIrst off, this is a great game you should play it!

Anyway this is a really fun game with a gameplay that you might not find somewhere else since let's be real there isn't any other air hockey team game so it is a unique game... 

This game does a lot of things right like character design, unique maps, story and music.

The more grey area/questionable things of this game would be the ranking system (everyone starts from the lowest rank and people have played this game a lot in advance before official release so skill is not really meassured until later ranks) and the skill gaps (one bad teammate means a lot in this game and trying to compensate for it is harder than any other team game)

For the bad parts I'd say that the friend list not showing who is currently in a match and the game not showing any notification when a match starts or when you're being invited is definitely a flaw and people keep either disconnecting or rage quitting for no punishment, this is going to be adressed obviously but as of this review its a big part of the game.

Wrapping up everything, despite the grey areas and the flaws I've mentioned this game is unique and fun enough to look past them and I want it to succeed so please give it a try. 

I'll update this review when these things change.",1

I was thinking maybe we would go to different areas, but it was really just running around the same place which makes the price tag questionable. It could be like $10 and that would justify how short it is, but $20 is a stretch for 3 hours of in-game play.

138140642,1774580,"Firstly, the game is fun. The new stances, customization, and side quests add a lot to the game's longevity. I enjoyed the entirety of the game, although there are portions where mindless puzzles and navigating can take away from the immersion I felt. For a $70 pricetag I think they nailed the amount of content and story I would want. For all the positives I give this game, I CANNOT recommend it. 

The fact that this game was allowed to be launched as ""gold"" is not only egregious but also dangerous for the gaming community as a whole. 

Not only did the game suffer from stuttering, hitching and fps drops but shortly after the May 11th update, which provided ""bug fixes"" and performance fixes, they game's performance got worse from my perspective. I suffered ten crashes during the game's last 10 hour stretch, 3 of which were during the game's FINAL cutscene. I had to redo the last fight three times and had to resort to skipping the final cutscene and looking it up on the internet. 

Adding onto this, after the update I experienced a multitude of texture issues. If I chose a customization on Cal that had a cape or hanging texture, every cutscene it would ""bug"" out, and take up the whole screen. During fights, enemies such as the magmaguard would be unbearable due to their textures having issues and taking up the whole screen. Prior to the update, I had no issues with textures. 

Ultimately, my experience with the game, and like many others, was poor. I had to lower the difficulty not because of the skill required, but simply because the constant stuttering was so bad during the last few sections of the game that I found myself dying during a large freeze. 

I'm currently running an AMD Ryzen 7 7800x3D and a Nvidia 4070ti. Hardware specs aren't a full picture, but running everything on high at 1440p should not be issue with smooth performance.

138140074,1774580,"Jedi Survivor is an epic game with an incredible story, a lot of interesting side content, and a huge variety of customization options, enemy types, beautiful world design, and heavy hitting combat. The game started with a rocky launch but since update 4, there have been NO MORE shader hitches, fps drops or bugs, the game has never crashed once, even before the patches. Much respect for the fast turn around and fixing the issues with newer 13th gen i7 and i9 Intel CPU's, the game is now utilizing the full potential of my i7 13700kf, I have a buttery smooth performance with an RTX 3070 and 32gb of RAM @ 1440p with Ray Tracing off, I've not tested the ray tracing as I don't find it worth the performance hit. Aside from the performance of the game, Jedi Survivor is what a good sequel should aspire to be, it improves in every way from the first game, and is without a doubt a more polished and better game than Fallen Order. The graphics in this game are top notch, gorgeous and compliments the amazing world design of the planets, you feel as though you are in the Star Wars universe, walking into a cantina and chatting up the robot bartender ""Monk"". There are so many little things, and attention to detail to transport you into a different world. Along with the main story, the side quests or ""rumors"" offer many different rewards and reasons to explore the open world areas of the game, each one is different and you never know what you'll find, it rewards curiosity. The addition of bounty hunters is another great use of side content, you can become the hunter and gain rewards for taking them out, they are spread all across the solar system. There is a lot more cosmetic options than there was in Fallen Order, you can personalize Kestis and his weapons the way you want, bottom line is, the performance on PC has been fixed IMO and the devs of this game have created a true gem of a game for the Star Wars franchise.

steam is also trash for allowing EA to do this absolute trash, notice how low advertised ea play is, coulda had the game for 15 bucks a month then just cancel the sub, same for all ubisoft titles, dont let these companies that very clearly dont care about you jebait you for 60-80 dollars. so cringe that this is the world we live in.",0

138146413,1774580,"Putting this review in here to combat the (deserved) review bombing from the first week...

The game thus far has been amazing to play for its narrative, combat, and mechanics. Really strikes a strong balance between satisfying and challenging depending on the difficulty setting you choose. 

I played Fallen Order on release as well and, while I really enjoyed that game, this is a level step up in its story-telling, pacing, and utilization of mechanics. 

My biggest gripe would definitely be performance still. The Week 1 patches fixed the lions share of issues, but there are still moments where the game will become laggy or unresponsive to the point I have to play around it. Really frustrating if it happens during big fights. It tends to be localized to certain places on the map. Breaks immersion for a few seconds, but I find it easy to get back into the game.

If you're ok with moderate quality issues and are more so invested in the story and less in the look of the game, then go for it. If you're expecting a polished high-quality game aesthetically and mechanically, then wait just a bit. As an aside, I would not recommend spending the extra money for the deluxe upgrade as it has zero bearing on anything and is honestly unnoticeable from a game-play aspect.

What I like: The style of the world and the avatars. Progress is maintained when you die, which prevents too much frustration. The pistols in the game are my favorite weapons. The story is pretty solid for a loot shooter.
What I don't like: The performance -> stuttering (hope this will be fixed soon). Enemies -> Battles are either frustratingly difficult or far too easy. The price is definitely too high.

As you can see, despite these flaws, i am going to recommend this game, for the same reason i recommend Hard West, and that is pure unadulterated charm and fun. Showgunners is fun, in fact, it is a blast. I had a truely enjoyable time from start to end thanks to its fast-paced gameplay, its fun characters, its solid voice acting and fun mix of exploration and combat. If there is one thing this Developer knows how to do its mixing up the formula on the standard XCOM style. While the story is nothing amazing, it fits. 

I say, buy this game if you enjoyed their other productions, or if you really like the demo.

138147297,1494420,"I just want to build like in Command and Conquer, where you can build walls, sam turrets, and lazer fences and be able to control the troops, so I can put some inside a lazer fence like prisoners. 

There are not enough buildings, and the modes you get to play are stupid. One is just a wave shooter; the other is just so confusing it makes no sense; and the third is the one I like, where you can build but you have to put it as a private lobby because apparently people can join, and then you can't do anything because they are controlling your troops.

 It's not like Command and Conquer, where your partner has their own base and their own troops and not enough resources at the base or on the map to harvest, and bugs climb everything instead of walking like you want them to. 

Instead of walking like you want them to, they're like, ""No, me, I climb this, me, I climb that, I'm a mountain climber, let me climb the enemy base and everything I can see,"" which is stupid. 

Humans and bugs move super slow, or maybe it's just humans. Harvesters are super slow as well. 

Also, there is no indicator saying enemy troops were spotted or an indicator when your troops are under attack or base, and there is no option to go directly to them.

It's a good game, but it's just bad currently. Hopefully, the developer fixes it and lets other players choose their own fraction.",0

138145015,1494420,very fun,1
138144559,1494420,"Ill give this a thumbs up for the sake of the potential. it runs more like a showcase of a new graphics engine right now, hardly any animations, micromanaging is really a chore but engaging, And the maps are far too big for what the scale is right now. But, with the small updates already on QOL stuff, this game will become something new and refreshing bringing some life back in the RTS community as well as a different take on some FPS games. Maybe let this stir for a few months before checking out.",1

138147532,2389440,"[h1]Overall = 6/10[/h1]

A cute little puzzle game with Escher style architecture and a relaxing night-time ambience.  Although there isn’t really a narrative or a lot of detail in the scenes, it still manages to deliver a lot of information through the characters you meet and the written language used.  It’s a good idea which could be filled out into a whole casual game, but there’s still a lot to be worked on – I got stuck in the geometry in one level, some items clip through each other, the sound effects / music loop a lot and get annoying and there’s little help if you get stuck.",1

138148076,1375900,This game has a high potential. It has the best graphics I've seen in its genre. It's still in early access and it will get even better as it progresses. If you love this genre you should try it .,1
138144779,1375900,"A very cool game that can become a banger in the future

The pixelart, simplistic but very satisfying mechanics and weapons, and a the soundtrack are nice. And the gameplay mechanics with the environment balances the gameplay quite well. Also, I can see a lot of the development decisions on the game becoming industry standards for this particular genre.

I love that I can just jump in and play for 20 minutes, or play for hours cause that last run had perfect upgrades and how I died was bullshit so now I gotta go another round

In future updates I'd really like to see some structures and even different regions. Even if there's an opening with a  temple and 8 surrounding obelisks it'd be cool af. Some obstacles to change the fighting pattern is needed (maybe will come with different game modes or worlds) Some sort of ranged mobs would be good to force combat strategy changes are needed too.

All in all its a game well worth its money, looking forward to what's gonna come in the future, congratz to everyone involved",1

138148137,1940340,"Eh... It's def not as good as the first one and it's def not what I wanted from DD. Not loving the direction they took at all.

Feels like they just rode the hype around other games doing well in that genre like monster train, inscryption and such, but not done all that well.

Cheapens the experience, no more real challenge, management, careful planning.

Too easy also, can literally grind the first chapter, max yourself out before going further in if you want to.

Can't sell items anymore which is absolutely idiotic, now it's either easting space in inventory or being tossed out the window. 

No more equipment upgrades either looks like... 

And no more dungeon crawling... Curios basically out the window...

And the stage coach bs is unpleasant and slows down gameplay more than anything else. Like I'm fine with it having hp and coach specific items. But it's such a slow slog to travel with it it's annoying.

Wish you could enable simple map view and move ur token around instead, go faster. Like it doesn't add anything expect annoyance.

A real fail on the devs part I think, pre sad what they did to my boy :(

Doesn't feel like they added enough new stuff either considering everything they took out, like 1 new class only ?

Would say either get at a deep discount like 10$ or pass and go play inscryption or better yet, Darkest Dungeon 1.",0
138148162,1730250,"like other reviews have said, it's similar to dorfromantik but a lot more simple to play. if you found dorfromantik too hard to play, then you might like this one. but if you enjoy the challenge dorfromantik gives--thinking ahead on where to place and how to optimize tiles--then you'll probably be disappointed by pan'orama. it's fairly easy to rack up points even if you only have a vague idea of what you're doing.

personally, i don't mind this game since sometimes i just want to turn my brain off and mellow out, but it definitely doesn't pose any sort of challenge.",1

* I don't think the Narrator is very immersion breaking
* I don't think that the researching is tedious 
I genuinely don't have anything negative to say",1
138147021,1159690,Very Good game.,1
138146545,1159690,"The TLDR is that Voidtrain is an average survival game with a gimmick that isn't utilised very well outside of aesthetics (which are pretty good, but hamstrung by gameplay mechanics). If you like survival games and are used to the bare bones crafting systems and clunky combat, this will be another one of the games you play and maybe enjoy.

The menu systems for upgrading are obtuse. When upgrading the wagon it isn't clear about how much space is needed or what you need to remove. The UI for deleting current parts to make space for a new engine is trash and refuses to work unless you slowly move around to get the circles in the right place.

Combat was a major draw for me (and was featured prominently in the marketing) but was overall a disappointment. Unfortunately, combat is slow and cover is arbitrary. The enemy weapons are hitscan and seem to be programmed to hit you after a set number of shots, so it doesn't matter if you try to avoid taking damage. Also later enemies seem to get armour which stops some of your shots, though the number and chance of this happening seems random and not linked to their models / armour. This isn't helped by the lack of any feedback other than the damage number turning black rather than red (or sometimes white, depending on how the game feels about your shot). Shooting feels like your stuck in muck with shots that should connect doing nothing and those you think would miss actually hitting. Shooting at anything that is moving feels like potluck on if the shot will register or not, even in solo.

Being tethered to the wagon during travel is a major annoyance. I assumed the range would be increased from its initial pitiful amount, but up to the point I played it remained stagnant. This makes traversing the void incredible annoying as even at its slowest rate the wagon moves it is likely you won't have the time to pick up everything. Even if you can, storage is very limited, especially on the smaller wagon, and you can only upgrade it once you reach one of the 'stops', at which point you have to hope you have enough materials saved up to for the process or you just have to move on. In addition, if you try to approach the wagon from behind as its travelling the game will try to 'drop' you onto the platform using gravity, but as the distance isn't set correctly it will instead repeatedly drop you just behind the wagon unless you move back, slowly float up higher then move forward with enough height that you can drop onto the wagon. Its just little things that I don't believe the devs could have missed during testing that lead to a general feeling of roughness to the whole package.

The point where I gave up I'd barely crafted every material I needed to create the steam engine 'module', fiddled around to delete the old 'engine' (which made no sense as it was just a manual lever so I deleted stuff until the game was happy) only to find out it was too big. At that point I was able to upgrade the wagon a little which would have BARELY fit the new engine on, but that used up some materials so I couldn't finish the upgrade. Even if I could have, the new engine would have taken up all of the space leaving nothing for the multiple crafting stations needed to refine the same three base materials into the twenty or so different items that combined in slightly different ways to make the NEXT things needed to upgrade. And after all this there was no way to fix it unless I left the 'station' and travelled to the next one to pick up the few materials I was missing. Adding a wagon shows a single icon with two of the materials I could already make, but even with them both in my inventory it wouldn't allow the upgrade. No idea what the game wants there. I guess that is a good way to pad out the game, but I dislike not having a good idea of what I'm aiming for.

During my time playing Voidtrain the actual gameplay didn't change. I was still picking up the same things, running into storage issues, making a slightly different version of the material I'd made already to make a slightly different crafting station. The quest system is just 'craft this, craft that, craft those' again and again and again, and the fact that it just uses the same three to four base materials for EVERYTHING leads to the gathering feeling super repetitive. Even when you unlock a grappling hook you can only use it to drag materials and not actually grapple hook around, which is a disappointment. Then again, it somewhat made up for the pitiful tether range, so that was a nice upgrade in a way. It felt like base NMS, but far more restrictive and limited in scope, which isn't a good comparison at all.

Animations are an issue as you can only ever do one thing at once. If you want to craft something you have to wait for your character to flip the hammer, put it away, slowly pull out the book, then you can select it. If you are reloading after a shot you cannot pick up items or start something crafting. Every single animation locks your character into that one action, which becomes extremely aggravating once you notice it.

Generally its an average game with a cool aesthetic covering what is best described as 'another survival / raft type game'. Maybe after the edges are smoothed off and some content is added it will be worth it, but right now the price is too high for what is on offer.",0
138146500,1159690,The game will force open a web page that tries to get you to link your steam and epic games accounts,0
138146154,1159690,"Since there is no neutral review going to have to give it a negative. 

The idea of the game and some of the mechanics are very original which is nice to see. However after spending a few hours I have to say its just plain boring. All the depots are pretty much the same. The storage sucks as you get all these parts for guns and different guns but there is no way to keep more than 1 at a time. You have to go to the workbench and do a tedius process to see if any of the weapon mods you find are an upgrade and its very confusing. Also pretty much makes it impossible to take mods off of other guns. 

Not gonna lie was excited about this game and the idea of it but its just really boring and loses its luster rather quickly.",0

138150264,2369390,"Far cry 6 is newest FC installment released 2 years ago, just recently entered steam platform.
You play as just random protagonist (male / female), dragged into war against tyrant Antón Castillo.

Ignore my playtime as i have over 100 hours on ubisoft platform.

Pros (+):
+ Supremo (backpack) serves as ""class"" for your character.
+ Non-linear ish progression.
+ Weapon & vehicle customization.
+ Graphic is one of best on market right now.
+ main story can totally be played to the end in co-op.
+ cockfighting, basically a free small fighting game inside the game.
+ Crocodile companion, with shirt!

Grey (*):
* Skill tree is now replaced by talent passive tied to your equipment.
* AI pretty dumb as always.
* They barely revolutionize the gameplay loop, so expect just more ""far cry"".

Cons (-):
- No text chat. just pre-set ""radio command"".
- Game would be fun if it can play co-op more than 2 players.
- Quite rare but kinda game breaking bug, which force you to restart game.
- Story progression only affect host in co-op. Guest need to re-play it in their own session.

138150373,2096570,"Yes, you can use smooth turn and turn off captions. Seems like the smooth turn setting only shows up after you start the game. Captions can be turned off only in the main menu under language settings.

Mind-bending puzzle mechanics that could only be done in VR! Looks and performs excellent, 120hz easy. No finger tracking but otherwise works great on Index. Awesome art and voice acting, feels like I'm in a spongebob episode for some reason lol. About 1 and a half hours in and still on Chapter 2 of 5, so at this rate its a decent length for the price. 

The most creative use of VR I've seen in a while, try it out!",1
138147853,2096620,"The game runs buttery smooth and the art style is absolutely beautiful. The protagonists attacks and abilities are cleverly made. Manoeuvrability is great and the controls are very responsive. My only gripe (as of now) is that in the first few areas I've been to, there are consistent rows of 7+ enemies all bundled together that you can stunlock with each attack and they have no counter. Take into account that 95% of the enemies can be stunlocked this way (so far). Which makes it less rewarding when you defeat a massive horde of them. Here's hoping the smaller enemy combat gets tougher as the game progresses.",1
138147567,2096620,Awesome game!,1
138146933,2096620,"I Recommend This Game

138145977,2096620,"Really nice character handling, the controls are responsive and intuitive, allowing navigation and action within the game world. These, combined with multiple different screens piques your curiosity and wants you to keep playing",1
138145778,2096620,"Amazing! Huge fan of roguelike games, and clearly one of the best ones so far. Great combat and animations. Really recommended!!",1
138151090,1924170,"They did it! I didn't have to rebind my controls every time i restarted the game! Jokes aside, Raceward has proven that they really understand motorcycles and it's amazing to see. I played a lot of Rims and a lot of the other 2 tt games. Those were fun because you could go fast without consequences. They were cheesy but really fun. Rims though was the experience i was really looking for. Great first person camera, realistic rider movement and physics. It was a great game with a number of annoying flaws. This game is much better with fixing the annoyances that rims had, but it still has a few problems.

I'll get the things I am sure people will bring up out of the way first. While you don't have to bind your controls every time you load the game, there is still no controller vibration. It's non existent on any controller besides the default xbox one controller.  I mainly play with the Elite 2 controller but I also tried the Dualsense and neither had vibration. 

Frame syncing does not work as intended. It's not a big deal to me to play at 60fps but the vsync doesn't work right. It doesn't allow tearing but it stutters and smears the image. Without it on and just using gsync, it is much worse. 

Those things aside. I immediately wanted to try testing bike setups, rain traction, AI races and of course the main TT course. Bike setup changes do have a better intended impact than they did in Rims, especially on the low level parts. Rain traction is good. It's easier in this game because you don't cook your tires like you do in Rims, but I still didn't have to be that cautious. I purposely got in the way of the AI and I didn't get thrown of the bike like Rims without even realizing what was really happening. So they seem to act better. Not sure yet about how fast they are on everything but they didn't seem to take crazy lines like they did on many of the tracks in Rims. I had to do the main track twice before writing this because it was just so good. With all the HUD off and music off. It's just so immersive to go around and to go fast. I do have the track memorized from years of rfactor and the other tt games, so that does help shorten the learning process, but it is so good. The audio, feeling of speed, dangerous turns, and of course the jump are all really exciting. 

So far this seems like another Raceward game I will spend a few hundred more hours in. I do really hope that controller issues get sorted out this time though, because sadly, it was never really fixed in Rims.

About 70% of this game is dedicated to hard-fail sequences (ie you make a single mistake, you die, you start over eg chase sequences, stealth sequences etc) which wouldn't be so bad if the mechanics and platforming were well-implemented but they aren't, they're just janky as hell.

Ive played this game 26 hours so far wich is nothing compared to the +2500 hours on AOW3.

First impression is WOW great graphics.
the skill tree is not bad but it seams like if has less options than before but i like how its structured in Tomes. I still havent figure out how to stick to 3 tomes only and advance further into these rather than being all over the place and having to use tomes that my race doesnt relate to at all.
THe race Evolution was being great untill one of the enchantments turned my proud human barbarians into Frogs.. seriously ?? what the royal Frog! the animal legs were a bit off but id rather have the games NOT change what i created as far as race looks go.
the Music is ok but i hope later on there is a MOD with old AOW"" and AOW3 music theme.

the new complexity of the cyties is nice. It Adds to the game experience. I dont like the City limit. If it takes resorces to build an advance city what is the need to limit how many we can build ??!

Everything takes a HEro to build. I dont like this. I need my heros to be doing HERO jobs, Not stacking bricks or planting fields.

 In the first one you not only managed your party but your gear and INDIVIDUAL members.  Losing your favorite character felt painful, but leveling them up and receiving beneficial abilities felt rewarding.  In this installment you take a run (or carriage ride) and can quit at any time, succeed or die and you start it over regardless.  Sure you get candles which take the place of leveling individual characters, but there's no attachment and thus feeling of loss when party members die or develop a multitude of negative traits.  Maybe this installment will appeal to more of a casual player base but for me I'm already losing interest after a dozen hours and may just go back to the first one.",0

But instead, this is a $40 game that titles itself as a sequel, but ultimately plays almost nothing like it outside of the combat. The gameplay, along with UI & UX seems to do its very best to waste the player's time, while somehow managing to be way less complex, yet also confusing. The worst combination.

I wouldn't call the game bad, but it's hard to recommend it at this price point.

138150439,1940340,"So I've played this game off steam for about 15 or so hours including the 3 something hours I have in steam (just bought it on steam today). I have about 60 hours of DD1 on the switch. 

I'm a big fan of lovecraftian/eldricht/cosmic horror. While I liked DD1 the thing that specifically turned me off of that game was the massive amounts of heroes to manage all in one run. From what I remember we would have our A team and do runs with them, stress them out, then return and slowly bring their stress down while managing a whole other team. A lot of theorizing inside of the ""town"" (I forgot what its called the place youre not doing the runs at). 

With DD2, at the start of your run you make your decision with who you want to run with and that is that. No need to manage a horde of heroes. Maybe unlock a couple that will synergize with your current team in the event that one of your people die. But thats it. The rest is just what I find absolutely orgasmic about this game and that would be the combat. 

Oh my god is the combat incredible. So much lovecraft, so much eldricht anomalies. Its absolutely brilliant. 

Mind you, there hasn't been any DLC's to this game yet either. I only hope Red Hook doesn't get discouraged by the reviews and gets to making some DLC's to beef up the game like they did with DD1. Yes people compare it to slay the spire which is another game I absolutely loved because it really focuses on the combat. The map layout is akin to StS. I get hardcore DD1 fans hate this. But man for someone that just cba to manage a bunch of heroes this game hits the spot. 

I get a lot of people don't like this game. But for me they gutted the part that I personally didn't like in DD1. They give us a relationship system in this game which I personally find a bit stressful as well because from what I've seen their isn't really any benefits and mostly downsides to the mechanic and a lot of your decisions you make to successfully complete runs depend on not screwing up your relations with each other in order to use all of your moves. It took me about 2.5 hours to complete a run while re learning the combat of the game.

I'll put it like this, DD1 is a game I liked and got my moneys worth out of (50-60 hours or so). This is the game that I would play at the level of StS. That is hours in the hundreds.

Tldr; If you love lovecraftian horror, and pure bred roguelites and you didn't like DD1 for all of the out of combat managing then this is 100% the game for you. They took the best part of DD1 (imo) and put it in this game with absolute love and care. If you like managing rosters then play DD1 (or NBA 2k or some sports game etc.). This game is for the people that love the combat of DD1 and also like roguelites.

138150173,1940340,"In an industry that likes to play it safe and release sequels that are simply their predecessor with shinier graphics, I appreciate Red Hook for taking some risks to shake their formula up.  On the whole, if taken on its own terms, Darkest Dungeon II sticks the landing.  When compared to DD1, with these changes there's something lost and something gained, and how much of each will depend on your own tastes.

The core combat system remains largely the same with the addition of more complex buff and debuff interactions.  The big changes are with the party management system and the overall structure of the game.  The best comparisons I've seen suggest comparing DD1 to XCOM, where your squad are individual iterations of a class that persist across runs, and DD2 to Slay the Spire, where each run involves an (almost) fresh iteration of the class who will evolve over the course of a single run.  What's lost is the tension, attachment, and sense of loss with risking a character you've invested time and game resources into; what's gained is that you don't have to spend hours grinding easier runs to level up replacements for the characters you've lost.  There's still some grind as you unlock all the classes, abilities, trinkets, and improvements, but there are no huge setbacks where your entire level 6 group wipes and is gone (this is why many had trouble actually ""finishing"" DD1).

Characters still get stressed out in combat, but the immediate consequences have been simplified to having a meltdown and losing most health or becoming resolute and getting a free full heal (with some exceptions like the Flagellant, who becomes ""Toxic"").  However, to counterbalance, you get consequences in the long-term relationships between the characters, which can give in-combat buffs and debuffs to abilities.  For example, a character might get stress relief if the other characters in a good relationship use a signature skill, or they might get a debuff such as blindness (chance to miss) because of their rage at seeing someone they hate use a certain ability.  It's an interesting system that takes some getting used to.  It works, but it's not immediately intuitive.

Most of the roster returns, but it's a trimmer roster.  No Crusader, Arbalest, Antiquarian, Houndmaster, or Shieldbreaker (although some of these show up as adversaries!)  But really, did anyone really play the Antiquarian much except in a few specific circumstances?  There's a new character, the Runaway, who uses smoke and fire as a good mid-rank option.  The abilities are similar to their DD1 counterparts, with some changes (Somehow the Flagellant bleeds blight instead of blood, like, you know, a actual flagellant would, but Balance Must Be Preserved.)  Some of the trinkets seem needlessly complex, with lots of conditionals attached.  And the choice to try to communicate those complexities entirely through icon equations rather than plain language description is a choice I hope they reconsider or revisit.

Overall, I'm pleased with the result.  Is it as groundbreaking as DD1?  I wouldn't say so.  But it's a fun game that has taken some risks to bring the IP forward. 

If you own DD1 on Steam already, buy DD2 through the Steam bundle instead of separately.  It will save you money.",1

It has some nice ideas with pretty environments and lovely music, but it's seriously marred by poor character models and animation (the stuff that isn't mocap), imprecise mechanics/platforming and egregious game design. 

About 70% of this game is dedicated to hard-fail sequences (ie you make a single mistake, you die, you start over eg chase sequences, stealth sequences etc) which wouldn't be so bad if the mechanics and platforming were well-implemented but they aren't, they're just janky as hell.

Speed of progression and the gameplay loop are probably the biggest let downs.

It was nearly 10 hours before I got the other middle mouse button grappling hook to explore but... There needs to be more. It's all scripted, predictable, and thus boring. Leave depot. Fight shark. Shoot mines. Fight outpost. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Every new ""level"" or thing that is introduced is just another fucking way to pick up base resources. Wood. Metal. Chemicals. Wood. Metal. Chemicals. You can now explore destroyed/sunk trains! Cool? No, it's not cool it's copy pasted wrecked train cars with the same wood/metal/chemicals. I can fight in an arena now?? COOL!

Gunplay is probably the most frustrating due to bad hit registration, on buildings/object. Shoot outs are frustrating because enemies always know where you are, always shoot directly at you, and generally always hit you (they just don't do a whole lot of damage). At later stages they just add more enemies with more armor, so you can't bum rush without burning through mats to heal or armor up. You also can't be tactical because if you try and peak around corners or shoot through railings you generally hit the corner or the railing. Anything you're close to will be shot, The answer I have found, is to jump off the side of the fight area (there's virtually one single fight area copy/pasted every depot.) The best strategy is float down to where I can't be shot and force the enemies to run into the same spot and pile up to where I can quickly shoot and hide to reload. It's really fun spending 30 minutes in the same spot bobbing up and down, half my shots going into the rocks or a rail because I didn't clear it enough, killing 20-30 people as they mindlessly run up to the same spot the last guy died at. There's also a significant lead time needed to hit moving targets, as bullets only travel at about the same pace as a sprinting man in this game.

So TL;DR Gameplay at the moment is a bit boring, predictable, and fights are mind numbing cheese strats. It needs more. More exploration, sooner. Make it so players can leave the train and find locations dense with specific materials. Put rarer components, like bearings, in defunct trains. Maybe make the player salvage them with a cutting torch? More variety in backgrounds. Less scripted events. Random shark attacks. Random mines (Although tbh I despise the mines and think it's a stupid event that should be removed altogether). Also needs some UI updates. Clarity, more information on gun mods.

Unfortunately, there are some snowflakes who have left negative reviews solely because they dislike Epic Games. However, I personally enjoy this game and I don't mind Epic Games, as that is my personal preference.

I recommend you to try this game, refund if you didn't like it.

Still rough around the edges (some QOL missing, weird small decision like update workbench/furnace not doing the basic version recipes, enemies difficulty ramping up weirdly etc.) + the small bugs, so wouldn't recommend the early access to anyone who doesn't have the disposable income for it, but reviewing it positively because all those are tweakable and fixable across early access period and the core loop/style is there and solid.",1
138150764,1159690,"[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
From going at a constant slow speed on my train I found the game a delight to play. The graphics and style is Gorgeous although a bit bright with the sun (brightness is at 33) and is just amazing to look at the base you've built while listening to the soundtrack.


Before reading other then the TL;DR do know that my save file was recorded at 16H and 45MIN 
and the ""Tile"" ""Square""... I'm guessing the amount of portals i've gone thru (not counting Depos) is at 8? and the entire time I played was on the slow setting of the train while playing single player.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2974527827

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2974527433


With Voidtrain the game is beautiful with it's graphics, nothing seems out of place with it's style and the atmosphere is just gorgeous, especially with the skybox/ sky around you, even when looking at the sun does feel like looking directly into a bright light.

The story i've seen so far is really captivating, the narrator has such a wonderful voice and I actually combat with myself with speeding up the train just to go thru more of the story (but often stop myself cuz I'm a massive loot whore)

The base building aspect is a wonderful challenge to fit everything, although a bit difficult if you want everything to be on the exact X or Z cords (like myself) but not a challenge when you use long object to help sort that out if you do care about it.

The combat AI is a bit.. basic? 
The alien enemies often just go towards you while the alien boss just stays in the middle (I got to round 3)
while the human AIs just shoots at you while changing cover every so often while knowing where you are thru walls, shooting at you thru them alot of the time (not shooting THRU but looking at you thru while shooting) 

I will say though with the aliens. I was a bit upset that they're cept behind the arena section when it looked like in the trailer you could battle them on the islands with them invading your train. (I could be wrong, but i've not encountered them naturally yet)

BUGS
I will say personally I've not encountered many bugs, and the bugs that I have encountered was movement where I'm flung around or one time where the entire train was teleported back with myself still being where I was, making me fly back to the train for a few seconds (tho I did like this since I got a coal node I missed :3)

If I had to give a rating out of 10 i've honestly say a solid 7 or 8, more if the combat is improved and a few of the bugs fixed
deff a game I will recommend to my friends when I finally have some",1
138150354,1159690,"The stupid thing is missing so many things. i just unlock the autogatherer but news flash raft did it better and sooner. you have too manual grind for HOURS. the depots are rehashed but only has a few doors for story... NO NEW DEPOT AT ALL.  course you may be thinking there maybe something interesting in space lik- HELL NO NOTHING. PLAY THE DEMO AND THATS THE WHOLE GAME. enemies? same smucks and 1 island pre-trip and some mines. SHOULD I SAY MORE? pets? they lay around and they disappear when i had two. no clue why? the layout is terrible and so is space management on the train. some of the items are weird where you can them.

138150415,1230170,"Overall game feel good, no bugs encountered. A few thinks I would prefer to be changed:
- Had some problems with being able to file the wooden butt stock to the finish, wasn't sure where I missed a spot.
- I would prefer to move be able to move to the sides while disassambling a gun. Only turning around isn't great for me cause, if I want to change my view from butt stock to barrel I need to zoom out look at front of gun and than zoom in again.
- There should be a ""play again"" button at the shooting range. When you play the sniper game you get 3 shots only. Instead of playing right away, I have to go outside of the range, select the game type, select my gun, go inside the range, start game, shoot 3 times and than go outside the shooting range again (annoying).
- Right now there is no option (without changing windows sensitivity) to have a mouse setting that's not sensitive. The lowest option i 0,2 and with this lowest seeting the aim is still way more sensitive than in any FPS game I play.",1

138150078,758690,"I put no but I mean ""not at this time."" The prologue, when I played, was absolutely amazing, even with the various bugs here and there. 

But this EA release is all but unplayable. ""Take off helmet,"" tutorial says (w/o saying how), so I figure out how to do it (remove helmet and place in inventory (as opposed to, ya' know, a fKKin hotkey)) then the game immediately closes the inventory and now I cannot move. I can spin around in 360, fine. But can't move. I cannot open the options menu via ESC, can't open up the inventory (TAB) or do anything so I have to force-close the game. 

Other people are reporting the game gets in an infinite load and the dev team is like ""send us your save file or we won't be able to figure it out."" Now, I GET that they will need a bug report but the sheer volume of people reporting this problem makes it really hard for me to believe that not one of the computers the devs are using won't reproduce this issue. Please. 

If you want to pay to be an Alpha tester, then fine, the game [COULD] be awesome down the line, but as it sits, nah. Sit on this thing for 3-6 months and come check the reviews. 

I'll update this review once we can actually play the game. If they need alpha testers, they can pay someone to do it. EA is not for this level of (doesn't work). EA is for ""help us add additional content and tweak things"" not ""help us get the game to work.""

**Edit to Dev response**
I was all about this game during prologue and bought it the moment it was for sale. I will NOT refund the game because given what you've done so far, I have faith that you'll be able to fix it.

But, I can't in good conscience recommend the game to anyone at this time for those very reasons.

I will update this as soon as a patch fixes at least those two game-breakers.

Thanks!",0

Mechabellum is quite good, very well balanced for an Auto Battler, the visuals are reminicant of Supreme Commander, to the point where I kinda hope that this is a jump-off for something similar. 

However, the game does miss something rather important; A proper progression system. These type of games need unlocks and ways to keep things interesting, which is simply way too shallow here. I'm also unsure of the monetization model; a Pay to Play game does filter out a lot of people, but I'm concerned that the match-making is going to die out due to population issue. A Free To Play model with a battlepass and cosmetics would have made more sense to me.

Overall, it's quite a lot of fun and you should try it out.",1

138155742,1774580,"Three (3) days ago, I had purchased Jedi Survivor as I am on vacation.  Hoping for something to fill the time.  Unfortunately part way through game play today, I had beaten the game. Now I don't mean just the story, I mean the whole game.  

SPOILER ALERT: We start with Bode.  I fully expected that some random person that Saw Gerrera to found off the streets of the Empire's capital planet: Coruscant, to be a traitor.  Like Saw what did you think was going to happen?  Also come to think of it, where was Saw the entire game? His name was mentioned more than a thousand times, but did not make a single showing. It's not like he's the iconic figure Darth Vader who was not mentioned once, but EA has not problem when he comes in to kill literally half of the remaining Jedi in the entire galaxy. 

Secondly, the overall content of the game is lackluster.  The price is $70.00 USD, but nowhere nearly delivers the amount of content that a game for this price should.  There are not enough side quests to keep the player interested through another play-through. Not to mention that because of the game single player nature, it is unavoidable that the main story line is going to have to progress the rest of the content.  Meaning, that you have no other choice but to do them in conjunction with each other. With just south off 30 hours played, I have fully explored north of 90% of each planet, found every mineral, and invited every stranger to a run-down bar that you are about to abandon.  

Unfortunately none of it compares to the flavorless wheat-thin that EA has decided to take on with their writing.  In the beginning of the game, Cal is being chased by the Empire (shocker).  Almost instantly Cal is steered off course to some planet located where? You guessed it, the Outer Rim.  How is it, that everything in Star Wars is located in the Outer Rim?  Why not no black hole pocket dimensions right outside the atmosphere of Coruscant, that leads you to a totally different galaxy? I don't know I'm just spit balling.  My point is, nothing can be in the Outer Rim, if everything is in the Outer Rim.

Unlike Star Wars, we are moving past the OR. More specifically, what is the point of the game?  Cal is the Empire's most wanted, and they are just going to ignore that until it is convenient for him?  I.E. when he is not off trying to correct the mistakes of his own actions, whether it be tearing the Mantis Crew apart, or letting some fallen Jedi turned space pirate, ensue havoc in the galaxy. This game had almost nothing to do with the first.  Because of this, it felt like the worlds longest side quest of all time.  I understand that you cannot disrupt the original trilogy, however we see others create new stories without doing that all the time. The first game is a perfect example. The whole game, Cal is fighting for the same exact thing that the other antagonists killed and died for, making him no better.  Cal doesn't even try to change the means of how he wins, unless provoked by others or it is morally convenient for him. 

Lastly, like all other EA games, I was severely disappointed at the amount of bugs that this game had, even though I had purchased it post release/initial updates. Constant crashes, failure to load prior game data, failed game mechanics.  You name a problem with any game you have had in the past, I promise you EA has made sure that it is in this game as well.  I never understood why big corporations releases all these titles, then get all bumfuzzeled when people give them terrible reviews.  

Don't get me wrong, the game was very pretty art wise, and if your into a hack-n-smash, than you should give this game a try.  It just seems that EA was more trying to give everyone the Force Unleashed 3, but fell short of even a bench mark for them.

138155571,1368890,"This is a really neat experience, even without VR, but it feels mostly like a tech demo.

Experience the trippy world of Hong Kong Obscure, find the nearest phone and get your objective, a timer starts, which also gives you a direction where you find said objective. Bring it back to the phone, rinse and repeat. you are armed with a flashlight, only with it you can see things that stay otherwise hidden. You can shoot balls around which feel like fireworks and are needed to dispose of some entities. Switching from the gun to the wire allows you to attach yourself to a frisbee you can throw and all the neon signs you can find. Its very fun to do so.

Now I call this a tech demo because you have a few toys to play around with and repetitive objectives, and shows you what it can, but does not really do a lot with it, and the city is a ghost town. You could add minigames, shooting ranges, or parkour courses for the wire, theres a lot that could be implemented, which is maybe the case in the future.

But it being a tech demo is not a bad thing at all, its still very enjoyable, if not a bit pricy. Lets see what the future holds.

I'm not much of a VTuber person but the characters still have a great personality just in their animations and the huge amount of nonsensical memes that appear everywhere. There's a bit of jank in how the systems behave compared to a more standard fighting game but it's not that big of a deal if you're just looking to have a meme of a game to play with friends. You don't even need to understand the memes to enjoy them.

On the other hand, if you like VTubers, but aren't much of a fighting game person, this game is still worth picking up - especially since it's free. Go in and just look at all the ridiculous references in there. The memes I mentioned earlier are going to be like 20x funnier to you than to me.

138156334,1940340,"I think it's important to recognize that this game is not like the first in the series. I feel that many people went into this game expecting a recreation of the first game with a new story or characters. If that were the case, I promise this game would have more scalding reviews that is already does. It would be boring and completely lacking soul.

This game is a beautifully done sequel. It retains so many great features that the the first pioneered, while invigorating the player-base with a NEW game. This is not a recreation of the first (which I have no idea why people are so disappointed about, like you can always go back and replay DD1 - it has endless replayability). This game is new, fresh and in my opinion it is a proper SEQUEL. 

The metaprogression is new and fun to explore. The carriage forces you to consider your pathing for what you need, rather than simply maintaining a Hamlet. It provides a fresh new challenge that is masterfully implemented. 

I agree with many of the negative reviews that it is not a mirrored copy of the first game, and if you expect that then relieve yourself of the expectation or simply go back and play the first and it's many DLCs. I disagree with all of them for being upset about that point. This game is excellent, new and challenging - just like the first one was when it game out.",1
138156187,1940340,"Animations and art are very good.

The gameplay loop is slow, the metaprogression is a boring grind and feels forced. The stagecoach feels gimmicky and just serves to slow down gameplay by forcing the player to choose between a few locations based on the wheel/hp mechanic, which also falls flat. I would honestly just prefer a static ""departure"" screen or map system to the stagecoach.",0
138156049,1940340,"Worst UI EUW, random symbols instead of names of status effects",0
138156013,1940340,"Lacks all of the sense of progression the original game had.  Character persistence between runs only seems to exist as an afterthought, with most runs starting completely from scratch.  The main way you progress is unlocking new drops for within a run, closer to The Binding Of Isaac than Darkest Dungeon.

The classes have more skills but there are fewer options for different playstyles than the first game.  Weird classes like the houndmaster, Antiquarian, and Abomination were consolidated into other classes or dumbed-down game features (i.e. pets are just passive effects now).

Unfortunately the game is quite buggy as well.  Latest issue: encounters where an enemy will summon a healer, who gets stuck in an infinite healing loop so (apart from fully healing enemies) the round then never ends and requires a mission abort.

A completely uninspired spin off, where the devs clearly lost sight of what made the original so replayable and unique.",0
138155985,1940340,"Stagecoach is so slow and useless timewaste
I'm not even sure if you need to avoid the stuff on the road or you should destroy them as sometimes it drops some items. Anyways for those who are hesitating, buy the game only after they removed the stagecoach or totally revamped it. 
Not many different enemies after 6 hours of play you see maybe 10 different enemies
Didn't find a setting to make combat quicker
Basically you should do a run in less than an hour but it takes you 4 hours because the pace of the game is soooo sloooowww

Positive things: good idea to use the paths like Slay the Spire
Artwork is as excpected very good

it's a game you want to like it but it's impossible they didn't think of quality of life. If the goal of the developpers was to make you lose sanity points IRL, they have suceeded.",0
138155878,1940340,"Does not live up to the first game. Greatly reduced the feel of the game by removing the town and confining you to the stage coach. You don't really get to develop a fondness of characters as they are all short lived for their trips. It removes the large macro concepts of the game and punishes you for trying out weird crazy builds, attempting more dangerous routes, and really overall exploring the game.",0

Some things I'd like improved include being able to the build requirements for structures before selecting them (you can select and hit the back button but having it beneath each card on the selection screen would be nice)

Extra animals around the biomes you create including humans in the towns

Snow on top of some really big mountains maybe?

An indication when you have 10 or maybe 15 cards left in the deck

138154648,1159690,"I would be happy to substitute this review once the game has had more time. I have wanted to play this since it's first trailer and have not followed the development in any way.

Plenty of good.

The bad.

Pressing escape to back out of menus.
Not being able to increase menu quantities with mouse wheel, lack of inventory dragging (clear controller bias).
Constant rubber banding with sprint.
Dropping all inventory on death and having said inventory vanish through the floor.

It's a great game and I will say it's a great game which I am having fun playing, but I cannot recommend it until much QoL improvement has been put in. I plan to continue playing it but I couldn't in good conscience suggest another should do so because of lots of little things which shouldn't be there in a game with this development length.

These are not content problems, they're basics.

Also the material quantities are huge for solo play, the crates are too small and the item stacks are also tiny, Inventory management should not be this hard in a game which you're riding on a really heavy ass train. It's not RAFT thematically!",0

138155858,1230170,"Oof. I can't recommend it in its current state.
First, the good: decent graphics that don't need a 7950XT to run well. Well-organized shop. Fair gunsmithing experience.
Now the bad: grammatical problems are common. Improper use of firearm terms (""clip size"" really? Really. Come on). No use of the word ""firearm"", as should be used, but instead calling all firearms ""weapons"" which is wholly inaccurate (firearms can be used as weapons, but so can a can of chili).
Like PCBS, this can be used as a teaching tool, so it should be a bit more accurate in the terms department. Very easy fixes, but since I actually work on guns as a smith myself, I can't YET recommend, again.",0

So far everything plays great on Steam Deck, The only issues I ever ran into were related to the epic game store trying to take control of the screen, so glad it no longer have to do with that.

I think it's a great game to pick up and play for a few hours at a time.

My only downsids is save transfers were a annoying to complete (I had to download & start the game again on epic game store, to transfer) & The lack of steam achievements",1
138154480,2096620,"This game is a joke. The controls are horrible and unresponsive. You cannot cancel your hit into dash and usually this is not a problem for me, but in this game they've decided that hit ends only after you can move for quite a bit, not when the animation ends. Your combos is a joke as well. If for some reason you stopped mashing hit it wont let you do another one until it resets the combo. On the ground - it's ok, but since you can do some pathetic attempt on the juggle combo it won't let you do another hit until you land. Jump has an invisible cool down to it, so if you try to jump the platforms fast - jump won't come out and you fall. Bots are so dumb it's no even funny. Some of them will just fly up after your combo and stay there for ages. Other ones just dot react to your hits like at all. They don't even try to hit you back, they will just go and do whatever they were paid to do i guess. The overlapping UI text at the shop won't let you see what is that thing I want to buy, because it's overlapped by my balance. The Boss fight of the first map (I assume it's the first map not the game, 'cause I didn't actually beat him) is so horrible designed made me think if I ever saw anything that bad. You end up in the room, with boss standing on top of platform and just drop some projectiles on your head but, You're so far down, you can't even see your character, so there's no way of dodging thouse.
Highly Not Recommended
Go play Have a Nice Death",0
138155663,1924170,"ooh, needs patching. And 'if' it does, then I'll amend the review. In the meantime...

Please for the love of god can the game remember my settings both in the custom race menu (why why why would you have Mass start the default ???) but also the settings in the race for ABS etc, I don't want to have to struggle once I've rammed the throttle down to change all the four settings whilst driving. Nuts that you have to change these whilst in the race.

Bike turning needs work, not sure if it's a controller thing or what but my bike really struggles to turn. From watching on board real life laps I know for a fact I can take most of the mountain course bends in 6th gear. Now I play on high real settings, so it might just be that, but I feel they might have messed this up quite frankly. 

Lots of bugs, sound dropping off completely. A lot of times when I start a race my gears don't work, and have to exit. 

Texture pop ups are bad, really terrible when you see stone wall textures not loaded in right in front of you. 

Needs work. TT2 didn't get fixed, I'm hoping this team have more about them though. Fingers crossed.",0
138155478,1924170,"i do actually like the game way better than 1&2 the only reason negative is not really into the progression to get to the main race  and the anti wheelie is full no wheelie at setting one so no point in higher settings , setting one should still come up more , biggest gripe for me is bike is way to slow from one side to the other changing direction so more responsive turning would be great . but i do recommend this game hopefully they add changes on handling and wheelie setting but i doubt it. if you read this do still buy it.",0

I really like how it can fulfill all those abstract needs. Being able to switch up the styles and colors of glasses based on your mood is a lot of fun too! It's actually so much fun! You have those half rim glasses, or the thick frame glasses, everything! It's like you're enjoying all these kinds of glasses at a buffet. I really want Luna to try some on or Marine to try some on to replace her eyepatch. We really need glasses to become a thing in hololive and start selling them for HoloComi. Don't. You. Think. We. Really. Need. To. Officially. Give. Everyone. Glasses?",1

Seriously, how can something be so calming yet frustrating (in a good way) at the same time?

138179414,1940340,"The meat is still there but this game has a very conflicting design.

The game itself goes with a faster play loop ""Slay the Spire"" expedition style. Which is okay to differentiate for something new.
That being said, the narrative and pacing get a lot slower, which get saturated by the faster loop, making it feels almost unbearable.

This game need speed slider and Skip options fast. The core of the game still as fun and maybe even better than the original in some area, the real problem here is how long it drags itself to the fun part.

This is the first time that I don't know if I want to give this game thumb up or down, I still enjoy the fight but the other parts were a bit too dragged on. I understand that this game wants to sell the atmosphere (which it did doing it very well) but it should give an option for those that want to skip, which much needed for a game that the players expected to die and retry a lot.",1

138179550,1159690,"For its initial release it's pretty good!

As others said, it's very much like Raft. Yet, it manages to be it's own game luckily. This game is more railroaded than Raft (pun intended)

What I like:
--Gathering resources and using them to upgrade my train.
--Gun Customization. Makes your weapons feel a little more personal and lets you adjust for different situtations
--Look/feel of the game
--Island puzzles. Not too difficult and somewhat fun (maybe add different ones to avoid repetitiveness?) 
--Rofleemo(s)

What needs improvement:
--Resource collection. Torn between wanting train to go fast and needing to crawl along for resources. Currently no incentive to go vroom unless you want to get to the next depot asap.
--Wish gun parts were a little more detailed. Ex: I want to add a grip that works like a machinegun, but don't know if it will unless I equip and test. The names of the parts seem to indicate what each one does, but its not straightforward. 
--Tech Tree. The ""chapters"" mechanic is interesting as it allows a little freedom in choice, but seems to teach the player how different techs work together. However, mostly feels like a resource dump. Especially with techs such as the suit that you're only going to make once. You end up putting almost the same amount of resources into the tech as you do making the actual item. Which feels bad if you spent like half an hour getting the resources to unlock the tech and then having to do it all over again (and then some) to get the thing you wanted.

Overall I like it so far. It feels like this game has a lot of potential too, so I'm excited to see what's to come (train hubs to switch tracks and travel back and forth between different stations maybe??).

tl;dr High potential for a good game. Fun for now, but if you're on the fence; maybe wait for a few updates to come out before jumping in",1
138178514,1159690,"To introduce this review I should mention the following 3 things which could differentiate your experience from mine: 
I haven't tried multiplayer yet but i plan to
I have a moderately high spec pc (3080, ryzen 5 5600, 32 gigs ram and the game is installed on m.2)
I really like survival games
So far I've really enjoyed the game and I'm sure I have a long way to go (don't know which gate but i'm on tech phase 20), but everything has been going smoothly up until now so I don't think the game deserves the mixed reviews it currently has.
Yes, it's early access but I personally haven't had any performance issues, i have all the settings maxed out at 1080p and rarely dip under 100 fps. Neither have i run into any bugs, not even minor. 
On the early access note, the content is repetitive as some negative reviews suggest, but it isn't to a fault, as a survival game it is the kind of gathering and upgrading ""grind"" that comes along with most other games in the genre so i'd say if you like these type of games it's nothing to worry about, especially as every few gates the story progresses and bit by bit new game mechanics are presented. As for the long term progression and how much content is in the game right now, i haven't run into any content drought 18 hrs into the game and judging by the amount of tech phases there are in comparison to where i am, i'm probably under halfway through what there is in the game right now. Of course how quick you progress depends on your play style but overall it doesn't seem to me that there is an obvious lack of content, I can see why some say the gameplay can seem slow or stale at times but this seems to only be towards the start of the game, as you progress your priorities change and the game gives you more content and less grind, again similarly to other survival games.
I read a few reviews before buying it because i was surprised by the mixed reviews status and many of the negative ones brought attention to the epic games login, I'd say this is not an issue worth a negative review (and barely even worth mentioning). It only prompted me to log in to epic the first time i launched the game, many games that come to steam from different launchers do this, many do worse and make you download the launcher too @ubisoft. Plus, these days most people already have an epic games account and probably log into the launcher from time to time (who doesn't like free games?) so again, this is not a big deal.
The only complaint i have at the moment is the combat can be frustrating at times, this might be something i change my mind about as the game progresses and i get better weapons but at the moment these are my issues with it:
shooting enemies while peeking around cover is annoying. And shooting enemies which are behind cover but have bits exposed is also annoying. When i shoot from cover most of my bullets seem to hit whatever i'm hiding behind when my crosshair is obviously not pointing at it, this is where i'm not sure if my experience will change as i play since i can't tell if the walls' hitboxes are bigger than the wall shows or if my gun is just shooting slightly off to the side and hitting the wall because its accuracy stat is too low. Alternatively when i shoot an enemy in cover the same seems to happen, i will look further into this as i upgrade my weapons but i have tried to look at where the bullets hit when it happens and i'm inclined to say they're hitting an invisible wall just next to the actually visible object.",1

Кстати, я подсчитал, одна пуля стоит столько же, сколько четыре оладушка.",1
138179770,2405540,"I already left a review of the game on the Newgrounds page, but I wanted to add extra thoughts. First off the game is good, I like it. The graphics are nice, and the controls are excellent. One thing the game needs most is variety. There are 12 levels but only a few unique “types” or world designs. I feel like the game would work better with some more levels, put into a world progression type (Sort of like ClusterTruck). The level designs now are good but more variety would help the game with replay ability immensely.

	A smaller issue I have is with the star system. I feel it would be better if the stars had a set location in each level (perhaps even hidden off the track) rather than a random location each time.

I already have been speedrunning this game for a little bit and that is its best attribute. With so many skips the game has many fun levels to speedrun. Balancing keeping the crates in the truck and getting to the goal is immense fun. Overall Cargo Truck Racer is fun and has a whole lot of potential for an amazing sequel!

Besides new unlocks, each run is a fresh start and isolated from the last so you can focus on the journey, how your selected characters are equipped to handle it, and dealing with the random events that can aid or impede you for that run.

I feel some level of increasing difficulty or maybe challenges would help encourage me to play more as completion would be more of a challenge.

-Second issue the trailer is a compelete lie of what it shows you i have played this game for 3 hours and moved through like 5 stages with almost nothing happening and all of them looked the same.
- Third issue the crafting weapon station idk what this devs smoked but never in my life have i ever seen a crafting weapon  system ever be this painful and RNG shit fest mind you the only way to get weapon parts is by killing NPC'S. NPC'S that are SO RARE THAT THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE TRAIN RIDE YOU WILL NOT ENCOUNTER NOT A LIVING SOUL!!

AI could use a little work (on the roadmap)
Crafting and such feels very linear! i would like some of the research/building be more up to me than the devs while keeping milestones and such!
TOO MANY WEAPON MODS! This wouldn't be a complaint is you didn't have to constantly go back to an armory on the train to see which every one does! I'd be ok with at the very least showing some kind of information before you pick things up considering you get a ton every station!

All gripes aside, FIrst this is currently Freshly into Early Access with alot on the roadmap! Secondly, THis game has a way of making me want to keep exploring and seeing what more the devs have in store for me to see!

I'm just a gamer leaving my opinion but i've had very few performance issues and out of all the early access games i've played this doesn't feel what some would consider Early Access, just might be lacking planned content!

The I'm a huge fan of grid based inventories is it's a super welcome system. One issue I have with the grid system is that there's no good way to modify your build later on in the game because the Gap for items is fuller and your own inventory is full too so you can't rotate or arrange pieces. I have a possible idea on how to remedy this which I'll throw in a wish list further down in this review.
Some of the items in the game feel a lot worse than others simply because of the flow of the game. Items that kill from a distance but don't ""clear a path"" to the drops create an issue because the drops have a despawn timer to them and if they're in the middle of a mob, you're not going to be getting them early on. On top of that, because these items don't allow you to get to the drops, you're unable to actually start playing the game and snowball.

Wish list:
-Being able to spend coins on ingame buffs or changes. Something like ""hold"" slots similar to tetris where you can hold a couple of items off the the side which will allow you to make some space in your inventory in order to let you rearrange your items. The hold items wouldn't be active but it allows you to keep something on hand for later. Also useful for if you find a good item in the Gap but don't have the grid space for it in your inventory yet but might later.
-A rebalance to some of the lower damage items. I understand that the 1 tile items are intended to be lower power but even taking a large number of them doesn't come close to a similar value to a single item that would take up the same amount of space. For example, 4 ofuda (homing amulet) is no where close to what a 2x2 yinyang orb does despite taking up the same space. I don't mean to say that the number should be homogenized, but rather just a bit more consideration of how the numbers in this game work out.
-A way to check spell cards/combos mid game.
-A back button to the main menu from the character select screen.
-Aya, Marisa, and Remilia are really rough to start out each round, especially Aya. Some way to help mitigate this issue like a passive for every character might help. Consider the passives not only early game but late game too, don't be short sighted. Something like Marisa having faster cooldowns would be useful early on and later.
-Aya and Remilia are basically unplayable given their starter items. Marisa can start given some luck but it definitely doesn't feel great.
-Being able to pick if I want my starting item to be vertical or horizontal. A simple toggle at the start and then a toggle when I'm in the gap would work,
-A clear indication if an item is vertical or horizontal, while they're usually fine visually some of them like needles aren't. A simple highlight of their current orientation in the Q description text would be a good way.
-Not having to rebuy items you turn off each round. Just being able to buy some deselects for a progressively higher cost each level but you can move around each round once would be preferred.
-If you drag an item of the same size on top of another in your inventory, they just swap places.
-More characters are always nice.

I think the game has the bones to be really good, I don't expect a ton of updates but I'd be happy to see where the game goes if there is a lot planned.",1
138186804,2349830,"Touhou Gensokyo Survivors takes the best attributes of a Survivors game and either refines or puts a creative spin on them. The polished game play is then compounded by an excellent score and with visuals both superb and characteristic to Touhou. However, one of the best things about TGS is in its accessibility. You don't need to a fan of Touhou to enjoy TGS, and I would emphasis that going into TGS without any knowledge of Touhou still lends itself as one of the best Survivors games available.

With that in mind, I highly recommend TGS whether you are a fan of Touhou, Survivors, or are just looking for something accessible, addictive, rewarding, and enjoyable.",1

Enemies are often overseen resulting in taking damage (Enemies have same color as the background and no visible outline).

Upgrade Art during runs is wierd and unrecognizeable resulting in always needing to read what every upgrade actualy does.

It's still early on but there's quite a bit of content thus far and what's in the game is interesting. There's enough to it that you have to think a little how you want to build your character to get better.

125670738,1492150,"TLDR:Decent bullet hell game out there,worth a look in the future,wait until devs fix the balancing.
To Devs:If you want feedback from the players as much as you say it is ridiculous to not have a discord server as a barebones EA indie game that needs balancing.Don't expect me to open a steam thread everytime I want to report something as a player or any bug/balance suggestion I find.

FULL VERSION:
Weapons and element variety are fun and unique to try.Your starting weapons will make you determine your elements you want to build early on.This is heavily tied to how much you have progressed in the meta-progression tree.There are a lot of issues with that because the bone(Currency)ammount you get early on when you are early in the tree is miniscule and your runs won't last long.Almost all builds fail early on and this is fine but the tree doesn't offer you a re-spec at all so if you feel like changing your build because you invested into one element you are screwed.This is where the tedious boring grind begins.Hitboxes are phenomenally bad and the slowdown you get while firing/speedup when you stop firing,in combination with how slow you are without any meta upgrades make the movement super junky.The game forces you to build around a specific element,you will get bored rolling the same builds every game because the map is EMPTY.I mean EMPTY.There are thorn vines that deal  1 Damage/3hp when you touch them and they have horrible hitboxes too.No gimmicks like shops in the run,altars,pickups or anything that the genre utilises to mask how simple and boring these bullet hells are at their core.A run lasts 10 minutes straight,at minute 5 during the first boss is the hard wall of the game(Before the final Mammoth boss).This will absolutely keep killing you unless you have a considerable progression in the skill tree due to sheer damage numbers because you will be closed in a box.By that time your collected bones are not a lot either.Go back to grinding.Quick example:Almost managed to win a run but died,I know I would have killed the boss if I didn't invest my bones in a single upgrade in the skill tree and had invested in some Wind upgrades for example.So I guess I will need an extra 1-2 hours left because the game locked me with no refund option as I mentioned,this is very unfun and not a lot of people have and shouldn't have the courage to slog through a game,I just need my steam achievements to fill my OCD.

P.S If they add content to the game this can be very fun but for now I think we as bullet hell lovers are already burnt by the ammount of these games that are unpolished.The price is very low and there is a 2 hour refund policy so you can try it out yourself,don't listen to me.I will change my review when devs put in some work and I feel like I can recommend the game.This isn't a price issue,it is a Respect-Your-Time heads up from me.",0

138188467,1849360,"I have been wargaming ""Cold War gone hot"" type of scenarios for the better part of the last decade - this is one of the finest experiences I have had.

SGS games have their quirks but what sets NATO apart from other titles is the sheer amount of different flavor and content you are going to get throughout each gameplay. During one playthrough you might see the Polish state crumble and their combat units become ineffective, because they have mobilized for the war effort which creates economic problems and social unrest. In another, you might see the Soviets send the reinforcements that would otherwise arrive in theater to Poland to quell the protests. This brings a fairly strong replayability to the game which I really enjoy.

Combat is still the good old SGS - nothing fancy. Somewhat simplistic, even. But the scale isn't operational so you should know what you are getting.

The AI is fairly decent and easily the best of all SGS titles I have thus far played. It presents a challenge for the player, if not outright match his capabilities.

SGS NATO's Nightmare is a labor of love. The devs are responsive with many more scenarios on the way. If you like the Cold War, get this game.",1
138190715,2364090,"This game is impressive, especially made by a small group!

•The story was interesting, and I liked the ending!
•The artwork was beautiful!
•I loved the voice acting (my favorite being the recordings from Dr. Kepler and Morgana) and looked forward to collecting the logs. It makes me wish that every log found had VA!
•The enemy AI was a bit weird. There were times when the sonar would say there is nobody nearby but then I would get killed (This was mostly at the beginning of the maze). There were also a lot of times when I would get killed/shot through a wall. 
•During the pistol shrimp section, after I got the lamps, I had to wait for 5 minutes before something happened. I was running around trying not to get shot, confused about if I had to do something else until I got jump scared by the cutscene. 😅 
•The instruction for bosses was unclear for the most part. I had to rely on what others were saying on the Steam page to find out what to do (this was prominent for me in the ""End its suffering"" and ""Finding its weakness"" bosses). This caused me to become frustrated. I think if there was more of a hint within the log recordings it could have helped with this problem. 
• The knife and black light were good for the most part. There would be times when I would have to flash an object five times with the black light before something happened. (This was mostly an issue during the eel and shrimp bosses since you are being chased during these sections).
•The map was well done as well with the setting being bright and colorful! There were times later in the game when I did not know where to go but I was able to figure it out eventually, so it was not a problem.
•I got soft-locked a few times during the third boss. 
•The music was also well done!

In the end, the game was still engaging and fun! The creators should be proud of what they manage to accomplish.",1

Make each character unique is one of the keys to replayabillity. 

2 more variety of upgrades. the ones we have so far are super cool, but i think we could have a bit more to choose from the pool. this also adds for replayabillity and builds.

138189986,1940340,"[h1]NAH, ABSOLUTELY NOT [/h1]

First, let me emphasize that I don't expect them to make similar to DD1 and I welcome any new change whatever it may be as long as it is fun, unfortunately it isn't. Even if you have never played DD1, this isn't worth your time or money, period. Don't belileve any of the positive reviews here, it's nonsense.

[h1]PROS [/h1]

Nicer graphics, nicer presentation. I like the newer 3d animation and adult proportions, not the dwarfy chibi style of DD1..... but that's it, that's the only pros. 

[h1]CONS[/h1]

[b]No builds, no variety, no rewards[/b]
Now... let me explain a bit about the gameplay. DD1 was very grindy, you need to build up your squads, level them up to dungeons, and keep on recruiting new mercenaries of different classes. You probably have your A team, B team and so on. When your squad gets wiped out, it pains you because you have build them up with so much effort. 

Here, there is no such grind, which sounds good but not. Essentially, all squad members have 0 individuality because you can't recruit 2 of the same class. So you actually go through 5 Locations, and each locations have 4 stages, each stage being multiple branching roads and a mini boss and a big boss, so there's about 20 stages total. In every stage, you kill monsters, get trinkets/equipments, and probably unlock new skills, there is a slight levelling up of your skill, but every skill can only be levelled once. And after you beat the stage boss you go the next stage right?

..... Here's the HUGEEEEEE problem, everytime you go to the next stage, ALL YOUR UPGRADES reset, your trinkets, your coach upgrades, your currencies, your whole inventory and even your skill upgrades. You even select your party members once more, which you can select the same one or different, but what's even the point? You can only run a single squad, so if you have run successfully with your previous squad you'll probably run with them again. So essentially, you are not building up anything at all, there is no special builds or lucky builds, you don't keep anything, zero. You play thru 20 bloody stages all like that, there is zero long term planning, zero variety.

In DD1, you start with a huntsman called Dismas and a knight called Reinard, if you manage to beat the final dungeon with both of them alive, you actually get an achievement for that. It's somewhat nice because they become special and you want to make sure they level up and survive, you feel an attachment to these characters at the end, and there's none of that at all in DD2. 

The stages also have 0 differences and variety in enemies and traps etc, because there is no way you can plan for them. in DD1, the cove have their own unique dangers and tricks, once you learn what they are, then you can plan your expedition with your B team (because your A team is all hospitalized lol) and come out victorious. 

Here it doesn't matter if your squad members die, you just need to make it to the end of the stage, then you can recruit a new member..., which can be the same member that just died, and because nothing carries over, they are essentially the same.

[b]Artificial Difficulty [/b]
So having zero needs to level up and build different parties, what do they do to make this game difficult? By adding weird nonsensical mechanics. Now, you cannot heal just because you have the skill or healing item, healing have a requirements of your hp dropping below usually 25% before you can do it, and then the healing skill has a 2 turns cooldown, so now they classify healing as a very strict & limited skill, which makes the Vestal class absolutely useless. If you are going to be so stingy, why not remove it altogether? There are other methods of healing but in essence, there is no such thing as a healer class now, healing is an unreliable skill.

What's worse is actually the ""stress system"", in DD1 if your stress hit the limit, you either get a random negative effect or positive one, and if you get negative one and you hit your maximum stress meter again, you die of heart attack, which kinda make sense. 
Now in DD2, once you hit max stress, you get either a ""Meltdown"" or a ""Resolute"" result, Resolute is easy, your stress meter goes 0, and i think you get a bit of health..... But if you get a Meltdown, you will lose about 90% of your hp immediately, and you team mates also increase their stress, so something like from 60hp to 4hp. This is what kills you usually, no enemies will hit you as hard as stress, so you might have a full healthy squad, then someone gets max stress, and their stress causes the others to get max stress too, then your healthy party all ends up on deaths door, and gets wiped out with a measly aoe on next turn. It's ridiculous. 

[h1]SUMMARY [/h1]

I could go on about why a lot of design decisions are stupid, but i'll just stop here. In short, it looks much nicer, but everything that makes DD1 charming is not present here, there is nothing of substance at all. I have over 120 hours in DD1, but I'm done here, I don't feel like playing this a 2nd time, there's absolutely 0 replayability in DD2. Save your time and money.",0

138191114,1159690,"The sheer amount of grind wouldnt be as devastating to me, if it werent for the fact, that it is just... so... damn... boring to do. 

Dont get me wrong, its fun for like a couple of hours, but the game doesnt provide you with helpfull instruments to make it easier as the game progresses. It doesnt help, that the crafting system is getting more and more exhausting as you progress further. 

Crafting system explained:
You basically got 3 main crafting resources. 
- With them you craft different kinds of crafting stations in order to get new crafting options. 
- Through the stations you craft different types of materials out of the 3 original ones. 
- The new materials are then needed to craft better versions of the old crafting stations.
- And so it goes on...

the better versions tho are no direct upgrade that provides you with both new and old recipes. No, it just gives you new ones, so you still need to keep all the old stations in order to craft everything else.

The result is you constantly running between 9 different stations in order to get one material you need. To be able to craft you mostly need fuel for your stations, that you need to farm as well. Manually.

A quick example. Lets say I want to get a chest type 1. First i need to farm the necessary resources. That takes about 2-3 minutes. Then you need to process. Luckily its just a type 1 chest so you just need to run between 3 different crafting stations in order to get the job done. That shouldnt take longer than 2 minutes.
So after 4-5 minutes you got ONE chest.
Have fun building a train.

Note: The game has potential, the combat is fairly fun and the concept is neat. In the current state tho I cant recomment to buy the game unless its 50% off. Core gameplay improvements are heavily needed in order to play it long term.

I did beta testing, played the demo etc... this EA version is so much better than all that have come before it, it is much more functional and more enjoyable.  I was annoyed with the other mode because you were limited in what you could do.  In this you have access to many features and you have to work your way to acquire them.  I find myself wishing I could load in a multiplayer team and knock stuff out which is a good sign compared to just saving and quitting the game for months like before.  Instead I have played it the last several days and look forward to continuing.   

The massive terrain system is amazing, it is endless.  There is plenty of places to salvage although it seems unrealistic in a way because... why are  there so many bases on a deserted planet?  Its almost like pop up tribes, but how did they get there?  

Major Pro - The developer is responsive to complains - albeit they are a small team and slow to act on some things.  Some things they seem to ignore because they want things a certain way which is understandable... but in some instances I feel should be more adaptable. 

Major Con - You die a lot for stupid reasons.  I have no doubt they will fix this, but man... I was doing stuff for an hour and it didnt autosave...  when I died because of my atv and realized how far back I had gone I was cussing like a sailor.  

I highly encourage them work on a temporary autosave system that autosaves the games every 5 minutes into a temporary location for up to 5 saves so you can choose where to go back to and also so that it does not overwrite your save file. 

Overall, I am happy to have purchased and supported this game.  I look forward to its future development. I also hope people who have only played for .3 hours quit lying on some of these reviews... you cannot even play the game for that amount of time and accomplish what they have said they accomplished.  Its obious lying.   I am biased because I supported the game early on, but I also have been disappointed MANY times along the way.  That in my opinion makes me a critic, and take my advice, if you want a casual game to play then this is it.  Does it have a ways to go... yes... absolutely yes.  Do I think they developers will continue development of this game?  yes.  

So overall.  It was a good purchase.  I am hoping it becomes my new ARK Survival replacement.  I play FPS games now because I didnt want a super addicting game like ARK... really hoping this is it.

138188953,758690,"I am saddened by the flood of instant negative reviews for this game posted before giving the developers a chance to respond.  Personally, I ignored the reviews, bought the game and really enjoying it.  It has worked brilliantly.  Yes, it does have a challenge to fully understand it but they warn you it is a game to offer challenges and that should be a positive feature,  Well done to the developers; three updates already, addressing issues as they arise.  This is an early access game, issues are to be expected but this team of developers are indeed very responsive.",1
138188923,758690,"Definitely not a recommendation, but I don't want to dogpile on the game.
Would highly suggest the developers to check out Stationeers, Astroneer and Planet Crafter, as the game seems to be sitting somewhere in-between. 

The balancing here is pretty bad - it feels like the early-game is artificially drawn-out as to stretch the available content. At the same time, it doesn't seem that the game is completely lacking of content, so why make the player waste so much time driving a half-broken ATV to grab 1 item every 10-20 minutes, while risking their lives (and patience) to do so?
Also, why does this single-player game locks so much progression over slow ""experience"" bars?

Mining is also slow and manages to be slower than hand-mining in Space Engineers. This indicates to me some sort of disconnect between design choices of making a slower/hardcore game (Stationeers) or a faster/arcadey one (Planet Crafter).

There's a reasonably large team and likely a reasonable large budget going on here, therefore the expectations would be high. I don't blame the people who are Not Recommending this right at the day of the Early Access release, especially considering the overall context of this game's niche.

It's better to decide early on whether the game will be more casual or more hardcore, and stick to it. Value what your playtesters are saying, and don't make fundamental changes to the experience before trying it out first. With the limited information I have, I believe the player started with a better/faster vehicle before, and this was removed prior to the Early Access release.

After 5 hours of playing this, I have 6 solar panels, a couple electrical equipment, and a ""functional"" hab (it has air in it, and potatoes). That's it. I can't even make my own ""Crafting Table"" (Printer) or even my own bed, because that requires me to spend hours crawling in the Martian sand taking damage to find a single item that will unlock 5-10 more minutes of actual content. 

Comparing this to the experiences provided by similar games made by smaller teams and budgets, and one is truly stretching their luck releasing on such a state. I'm not even mentioning the issues brought up by other people, I'm only focusing on the balancing aspect.

The performance issues should probably be looked at over time, and I'd recommend a graphics overhaul as well - a lot of models and textures here look strange or very dated, while others look better.
The ""escape the explody space station"" section seriously need to be looked at and reworked, at least adding waypoints. The current campaign is pretty questionable - would have been better to keep it locked and only include the tutorials and free play.

Despite the jankiness and jerkiness of character movement and animations, if truly cared for and worked on, this could become a fun game on the ""space survival"" genre - especially if it does involve creating a liveable habitat and a working colony for actual AI colonists to do stuff in.
I don't believe just building on what is available is enough for this to revert into a positively reviewed game, however. Reworks and rethinks will definitely need to be made, and not every game can go through that.",1

138189727,1972050,"I know I'm not that far in yet, but I've made it to the first weekend.

I am not typically one for dating sims, but this game has a lot of heart. You can tell that from the writing and storytelling, graphics and design, and music atmosphere that this was a labor of love from start to finish. 

As someone who was in the pit in marching band my freshman year, and then transitioned to bass drum, I really wanted to like Doug, but I found myself drawn a lot more to Sam's calmness and Garth's fun loving, yet ambitious spirit. There's a lot of great references that anyone who has attended band camp will understand, recognize, and be able to connect with on a personal level. All of the characters have such human qualities and characteristics. You want to get to know them better and ask the right questions!

The only critiques I have are those that would probably be fixed with a larger budget. I'd like more voiceover of the conversations, but the work that has been done is well executed and is sprinkled in just enough to keep your imagination engaged while pushing the story forward. It may even be purposeful, but I'm newer to the genre.

Make sure you save your progress as you go, and don't be afraid to let your heart guide you! You'll have fun and be glad you did.

Overall, great job to the team and can't wait to dive in further.",1

138189483,669330,"I say that something like this needs to be seen and experienced by everyone interested in trying new video games. give it a shot. an auto-battler as a concept might seem boring to some, but it interested me - I've never tried one before. the hook is that you can't move your units once they're set, you can only move the units you just put down, then THEY'RE locked into place . . . so each match you're constantly updating and (hopefully) complimenting those first unit / placement tactics you set . . . which makes every decision important, meaning one misplaced unit could well be it (and one WELL-placed unit can mean your victory). it's a constantly updating game of Rock / Paper / Scissors (or Bot / Plane / Lasers, as it were). a great concept with tight visuals and interface. 

as for the learning curve, I don't see it as PUNISHING I see it as PUSHING us to learn and adapt from past mistakes. be vigilant, study up what units do what . . . smart people like yourselves can absolutely do it. 

and since it's priced at what, 15 dollars? pft. I can totally see people getting thousands and thousands of hours from this if they keep up with their community's thoughts and wishes WHILE not giving them absolutely everything they want. (in my experience we rarely know what we ACTUALLY want; maybe especially in video games). 

and keep it sharp! keep the edge! the fact you can totally blow a match in devastating, humiliating failure means you burn those lessons hard into the minds of new players (like me). I have no idea if I'll play this for another hour or another hundred hours. I've already gotten my money's worth just by experiencing something so confident, new and deceptively deep. 

btw; single player IS a thing -- there are AI Skirmishes, Practice Grounds, Training Grounds, Challenges, the whole deal. it's a strategy sandbox. (my favorite kind). they give us the box, they give us the sand, they give us the toys and we're allowed to get up to all sorts of creative mischief. I love games like this. no cliche cinematic story beats, no A-B progression, no skin-you-alive microtransaction Ubi-Arts horseshit [*at present]. 

I can seriously say I urge absolutely everyone to give this a shot. at launch, ON sale, the price is too generous for what you get for me to be guarded in recommending you try it. (also a seemingly fun, inviting community in what little experience I have with it.)

just try it. if you don't think you'll dig an auto-battler, you never know until you know. I say give it a shot. that's my recommendation.",1

138189609,1559600,"As a lifelong horse game enthusiast, I believe 'The Ranch of Rivershine' gets the genre right. It perfectly captures the old school horse games I grew up with, with borrowed elements from more modern farming simulators, to create a cozy, feel-good game that's delightful to play at any pace.

Bear in mind this is an Early Access game at the time of my writing this review, things will change and improve. Even so, the game is quite fleshed out at the moment. There are bugs, as with every EA release but I have not encountered any that impact my enjoyment of the game, and the developer has been very responsive in stamping those bugs out. 

Currently, the game offers three trails to ride in, along with the ranch and town. These areas are quite lovely to explore. The game also features an auction house with various tiers of horses where you purchase and sell your horses by bidding on them; more rare horses have higher stats and rare coat patterns. The main activity of the game are the cross country competitions, and horse training, but there is also horse care, farming, and breeding and raising foals. There are also quite a few quests that teach you how to play the game and introduce you the story and it's charming characters.

The story is simple - the town of Rivershine used to have a famous championship rider, which brought success to the town, but no longer. It's up to you to bring fame to the town once again by winning cross country competitions with your horses. As you do you attract more vendors and characters to the town, unlocking new trails, better horses to buy, and expansions for your ranch. The game gives you a lot of freedom in how exactly you improve your herd of horses. You can train them, make money and buy better horses, or breed and raise foals with better stats (the breeding in particular is very fun and rewarding). No one approach is better than the other, and you can play the game at any pace you like. Even when struggling to win certain competitions, I was never frustrated, as there was always a way to either train my horse or get horse with better stats. The game also has changing seasons, which makes the landscape fun to re-explore and effects your farming.

My only criticism would be that the game could benefit from more variety in the day-to-day activities. You spend most of your days racing and training, and while these are very fun, it can get a bit grindy if they're the only things you're focused on. Given that this game is still Early Access, I believe these improvements will come eventually, especially looking at what the developer has planned.

I think the best part of the game are the horses themselves. Charming animations and small details make Rivershine's horses really feel like animals, rather than vehicles you need to occasionally feed and brush. I feel like so many horse games forget this. Rivershine gets it right. The horses nicker 'hello' when you enter the stable, will follow you around the pasture if you have enough trust with them, turn their head to look at you, the foals even follow their mother around. Your horses grow and improve in their skills alongside you, as you improve at the game. The horses are so adorable you just have to stop every once in a while to gush over them.

Overall, 'The Ranch of Rivershine' is a breath of fresh air in the horse game genre, and I think it brings quite a few interesting elements to the farming/ranch sim genre as well. Its leisurely pace, cute graphics, wonderful music and open-ended quests make for a perfect game to chill out too. There's clearly been a lot of care and love put into this game that horse game enthusiasts like myself will appreciate. If you're a horse game fan, or just looking for a feel-good cozy game, I recommend giving 'The Ranch of Rivershine' a look!",1

138188467,1849360,"I have been wargaming ""Cold War gone hot"" type of scenarios for the better part of the last decade - this is one of the finest experiences I have had.

SGS games have their quirks but what sets NATO apart from other titles is the sheer amount of different flavor and content you are going to get throughout each gameplay. During one playthrough you might see the Polish state crumble and their combat units become ineffective, because they have mobilized for the war effort which creates economic problems and social unrest. In another, you might see the Soviets send the reinforcements that would otherwise arrive in theater to Poland to quell the protests. This brings a fairly strong replayability to the game which I really enjoy.

Combat is still the good old SGS - nothing fancy. Somewhat simplistic, even. But the scale isn't operational so you should know what you are getting.

The AI is fairly decent and easily the best of all SGS titles I have thus far played. It presents a challenge for the player, if not outright match his capabilities.

•The story was interesting, and I liked the ending!
•The artwork was beautiful!
•I loved the voice acting (my favorite being the recordings from Dr. Kepler and Morgana) and looked forward to collecting the logs. It makes me wish that every log found had VA!
•The enemy AI was a bit weird. There were times when the sonar would say there is nobody nearby but then I would get killed (This was mostly at the beginning of the maze). There were also a lot of times when I would get killed/shot through a wall. 
•During the pistol shrimp section, after I got the lamps, I had to wait for 5 minutes before something happened. I was running around trying not to get shot, confused about if I had to do something else until I got jump scared by the cutscene. 😅 
•The instruction for bosses was unclear for the most part. I had to rely on what others were saying on the Steam page to find out what to do (this was prominent for me in the ""End its suffering"" and ""Finding its weakness"" bosses). This caused me to become frustrated. I think if there was more of a hint within the log recordings it could have helped with this problem. 
• The knife and black light were good for the most part. There would be times when I would have to flash an object five times with the black light before something happened. (This was mostly an issue during the eel and shrimp bosses since you are being chased during these sections).
•The map was well done as well with the setting being bright and colorful! There were times later in the game when I did not know where to go but I was able to figure it out eventually, so it was not a problem.
•I got soft-locked a few times during the third boss. 
•The music was also well done!

First, let me emphasize that I don't expect them to make similar to DD1 and I welcome any new change whatever it may be as long as it is fun, unfortunately it isn't. Even if you have never played DD1, this isn't worth your time or money, period. Don't belileve any of the positive reviews here, it's nonsense.

[h1]PROS [/h1]

Nicer graphics, nicer presentation. I like the newer 3d animation and adult proportions, not the dwarfy chibi style of DD1..... but that's it, that's the only pros. 

[h1]CONS[/h1]

[b]No builds, no variety, no rewards[/b]
Now... let me explain a bit about the gameplay. DD1 was very grindy, you need to build up your squads, level them up to dungeons, and keep on recruiting new mercenaries of different classes. You probably have your A team, B team and so on. When your squad gets wiped out, it pains you because you have build them up with so much effort. 

Here, there is no such grind, which sounds good but not. Essentially, all squad members have 0 individuality because you can't recruit 2 of the same class. So you actually go through 5 Locations, and each locations have 4 stages, each stage being multiple branching roads and a mini boss and a big boss, so there's about 20 stages total. In every stage, you kill monsters, get trinkets/equipments, and probably unlock new skills, there is a slight levelling up of your skill, but every skill can only be levelled once. And after you beat the stage boss you go the next stage right?

..... Here's the HUGEEEEEE problem, everytime you go to the next stage, ALL YOUR UPGRADES reset, your trinkets, your coach upgrades, your currencies, your whole inventory and even your skill upgrades. You even select your party members once more, which you can select the same one or different, but what's even the point? You can only run a single squad, so if you have run successfully with your previous squad you'll probably run with them again. So essentially, you are not building up anything at all, there is no special builds or lucky builds, you don't keep anything, zero. You play thru 20 bloody stages all like that, there is zero long term planning, zero variety.

In DD1, you start with a huntsman called Dismas and a knight called Reinard, if you manage to beat the final dungeon with both of them alive, you actually get an achievement for that. It's somewhat nice because they become special and you want to make sure they level up and survive, you feel an attachment to these characters at the end, and there's none of that at all in DD2. 

The stages also have 0 differences and variety in enemies and traps etc, because there is no way you can plan for them. in DD1, the cove have their own unique dangers and tricks, once you learn what they are, then you can plan your expedition with your B team (because your A team is all hospitalized lol) and come out victorious. 

Here it doesn't matter if your squad members die, you just need to make it to the end of the stage, then you can recruit a new member..., which can be the same member that just died, and because nothing carries over, they are essentially the same.

[b]Artificial Difficulty [/b]
So having zero needs to level up and build different parties, what do they do to make this game difficult? By adding weird nonsensical mechanics. Now, you cannot heal just because you have the skill or healing item, healing have a requirements of your hp dropping below usually 25% before you can do it, and then the healing skill has a 2 turns cooldown, so now they classify healing as a very strict & limited skill, which makes the Vestal class absolutely useless. If you are going to be so stingy, why not remove it altogether? There are other methods of healing but in essence, there is no such thing as a healer class now, healing is an unreliable skill.

What's worse is actually the ""stress system"", in DD1 if your stress hit the limit, you either get a random negative effect or positive one, and if you get negative one and you hit your maximum stress meter again, you die of heart attack, which kinda make sense. 
Now in DD2, once you hit max stress, you get either a ""Meltdown"" or a ""Resolute"" result, Resolute is easy, your stress meter goes 0, and i think you get a bit of health..... But if you get a Meltdown, you will lose about 90% of your hp immediately, and you team mates also increase their stress, so something like from 60hp to 4hp. This is what kills you usually, no enemies will hit you as hard as stress, so you might have a full healthy squad, then someone gets max stress, and their stress causes the others to get max stress too, then your healthy party all ends up on deaths door, and gets wiped out with a measly aoe on next turn. It's ridiculous. 

[h1]SUMMARY [/h1]

I could go on about why a lot of design decisions are stupid, but i'll just stop here. In short, it looks much nicer, but everything that makes DD1 charming is not present here, there is nothing of substance at all. I have over 120 hours in DD1, but I'm done here, I don't feel like playing this a 2nd time, there's absolutely 0 replayability in DD2. Save your time and money.",0

138191114,1159690,"The sheer amount of grind wouldnt be as devastating to me, if it werent for the fact, that it is just... so... damn... boring to do. 

Dont get me wrong, its fun for like a couple of hours, but the game doesnt provide you with helpfull instruments to make it easier as the game progresses. It doesnt help, that the crafting system is getting more and more exhausting as you progress further. 

Crafting system explained:
You basically got 3 main crafting resources. 
- With them you craft different kinds of crafting stations in order to get new crafting options. 
- Through the stations you craft different types of materials out of the 3 original ones. 
- The new materials are then needed to craft better versions of the old crafting stations.
- And so it goes on...

the better versions tho are no direct upgrade that provides you with both new and old recipes. No, it just gives you new ones, so you still need to keep all the old stations in order to craft everything else.

The result is you constantly running between 9 different stations in order to get one material you need. To be able to craft you mostly need fuel for your stations, that you need to farm as well. Manually.

A quick example. Lets say I want to get a chest type 1. First i need to farm the necessary resources. That takes about 2-3 minutes. Then you need to process. Luckily its just a type 1 chest so you just need to run between 3 different crafting stations in order to get the job done. That shouldnt take longer than 2 minutes.
So after 4-5 minutes you got ONE chest.
Have fun building a train.

Note: The game has potential, the combat is fairly fun and the concept is neat. In the current state tho I cant recomment to buy the game unless its 50% off. Core gameplay improvements are heavily needed in order to play it long term.

The game is not finished, I think it is far away from that. This is a point for the studio and developers, there is ton of work ahead of you.

I have started with Campaign and got bored, so I understand negative reviews on that front, however maybe they are not fair as it is only small part of the game. 
Once you will move to Free Play it is where the fun begins from my point of view.
The game is not easy, you need to be patient but after a while it will give you a lot of joy, I am sure of that.

Give it a chance, it is $20 or so for the best living on Mars simulation out there.",1
138190388,758690,"This review is during the first few days.  I have played the game in the evenings and today while I am off of work.  

Take it for what you will. 

I did beta testing, played the demo etc... this EA version is so much better than all that have come before it, it is much more functional and more enjoyable.  I was annoyed with the other mode because you were limited in what you could do.  In this you have access to many features and you have to work your way to acquire them.  I find myself wishing I could load in a multiplayer team and knock stuff out which is a good sign compared to just saving and quitting the game for months like before.  Instead I have played it the last several days and look forward to continuing.   

The massive terrain system is amazing, it is endless.  There is plenty of places to salvage although it seems unrealistic in a way because... why are  there so many bases on a deserted planet?  Its almost like pop up tribes, but how did they get there?  

Major Pro - The developer is responsive to complains - albeit they are a small team and slow to act on some things.  Some things they seem to ignore because they want things a certain way which is understandable... but in some instances I feel should be more adaptable. 

Major Con - You die a lot for stupid reasons.  I have no doubt they will fix this, but man... I was doing stuff for an hour and it didnt autosave...  when I died because of my atv and realized how far back I had gone I was cussing like a sailor.  

I highly encourage them work on a temporary autosave system that autosaves the games every 5 minutes into a temporary location for up to 5 saves so you can choose where to go back to and also so that it does not overwrite your save file. 

Overall, I am happy to have purchased and supported this game.  I look forward to its future development. I also hope people who have only played for .3 hours quit lying on some of these reviews... you cannot even play the game for that amount of time and accomplish what they have said they accomplished.  Its obious lying.   I am biased because I supported the game early on, but I also have been disappointed MANY times along the way.  That in my opinion makes me a critic, and take my advice, if you want a casual game to play then this is it.  Does it have a ways to go... yes... absolutely yes.  Do I think they developers will continue development of this game?  yes.  

So overall.  It was a good purchase.  I am hoping it becomes my new ARK Survival replacement.  I play FPS games now because I didnt want a super addicting game like ARK... really hoping this is it.

138188953,758690,"I am saddened by the flood of instant negative reviews for this game posted before giving the developers a chance to respond.  Personally, I ignored the reviews, bought the game and really enjoying it.  It has worked brilliantly.  Yes, it does have a challenge to fully understand it but they warn you it is a game to offer challenges and that should be a positive feature,  Well done to the developers; three updates already, addressing issues as they arise.  This is an early access game, issues are to be expected but this team of developers are indeed very responsive.",1
138188923,758690,"Definitely not a recommendation, but I don't want to dogpile on the game.
Would highly suggest the developers to check out Stationeers, Astroneer and Planet Crafter, as the game seems to be sitting somewhere in-between. 

The balancing here is pretty bad - it feels like the early-game is artificially drawn-out as to stretch the available content. At the same time, it doesn't seem that the game is completely lacking of content, so why make the player waste so much time driving a half-broken ATV to grab 1 item every 10-20 minutes, while risking their lives (and patience) to do so?
Also, why does this single-player game locks so much progression over slow ""experience"" bars?

Mining is also slow and manages to be slower than hand-mining in Space Engineers. This indicates to me some sort of disconnect between design choices of making a slower/hardcore game (Stationeers) or a faster/arcadey one (Planet Crafter).

There's a reasonably large team and likely a reasonable large budget going on here, therefore the expectations would be high. I don't blame the people who are Not Recommending this right at the day of the Early Access release, especially considering the overall context of this game's niche.

It's better to decide early on whether the game will be more casual or more hardcore, and stick to it. Value what your playtesters are saying, and don't make fundamental changes to the experience before trying it out first. With the limited information I have, I believe the player started with a better/faster vehicle before, and this was removed prior to the Early Access release.

After 5 hours of playing this, I have 6 solar panels, a couple electrical equipment, and a ""functional"" hab (it has air in it, and potatoes). That's it. I can't even make my own ""Crafting Table"" (Printer) or even my own bed, because that requires me to spend hours crawling in the Martian sand taking damage to find a single item that will unlock 5-10 more minutes of actual content. 

Comparing this to the experiences provided by similar games made by smaller teams and budgets, and one is truly stretching their luck releasing on such a state. I'm not even mentioning the issues brought up by other people, I'm only focusing on the balancing aspect.

The performance issues should probably be looked at over time, and I'd recommend a graphics overhaul as well - a lot of models and textures here look strange or very dated, while others look better.
The ""escape the explody space station"" section seriously need to be looked at and reworked, at least adding waypoints. The current campaign is pretty questionable - would have been better to keep it locked and only include the tutorials and free play.

Despite the jankiness and jerkiness of character movement and animations, if truly cared for and worked on, this could become a fun game on the ""space survival"" genre - especially if it does involve creating a liveable habitat and a working colony for actual AI colonists to do stuff in.
I don't believe just building on what is available is enough for this to revert into a positively reviewed game, however. Reworks and rethinks will definitely need to be made, and not every game can go through that.",1

138189727,1972050,"I know I'm not that far in yet, but I've made it to the first weekend.

I am not typically one for dating sims, but this game has a lot of heart. You can tell that from the writing and storytelling, graphics and design, and music atmosphere that this was a labor of love from start to finish. 

As someone who was in the pit in marching band my freshman year, and then transitioned to bass drum, I really wanted to like Doug, but I found myself drawn a lot more to Sam's calmness and Garth's fun loving, yet ambitious spirit. There's a lot of great references that anyone who has attended band camp will understand, recognize, and be able to connect with on a personal level. All of the characters have such human qualities and characteristics. You want to get to know them better and ask the right questions!

The only critiques I have are those that would probably be fixed with a larger budget. I'd like more voiceover of the conversations, but the work that has been done is well executed and is sprinkled in just enough to keep your imagination engaged while pushing the story forward. It may even be purposeful, but I'm newer to the genre.

Make sure you save your progress as you go, and don't be afraid to let your heart guide you! You'll have fun and be glad you did.

138189483,669330,"I say that something like this needs to be seen and experienced by everyone interested in trying new video games. give it a shot. an auto-battler as a concept might seem boring to some, but it interested me - I've never tried one before. the hook is that you can't move your units once they're set, you can only move the units you just put down, then THEY'RE locked into place . . . so each match you're constantly updating and (hopefully) complimenting those first unit / placement tactics you set . . . which makes every decision important, meaning one misplaced unit could well be it (and one WELL-placed unit can mean your victory). it's a constantly updating game of Rock / Paper / Scissors (or Bot / Plane / Lasers, as it were). a great concept with tight visuals and interface. 

as for the learning curve, I don't see it as PUNISHING I see it as PUSHING us to learn and adapt from past mistakes. be vigilant, study up what units do what . . . smart people like yourselves can absolutely do it. 

and since it's priced at what, 15 dollars? pft. I can totally see people getting thousands and thousands of hours from this if they keep up with their community's thoughts and wishes WHILE not giving them absolutely everything they want. (in my experience we rarely know what we ACTUALLY want; maybe especially in video games). 

and keep it sharp! keep the edge! the fact you can totally blow a match in devastating, humiliating failure means you burn those lessons hard into the minds of new players (like me). I have no idea if I'll play this for another hour or another hundred hours. I've already gotten my money's worth just by experiencing something so confident, new and deceptively deep. 

btw; single player IS a thing -- there are AI Skirmishes, Practice Grounds, Training Grounds, Challenges, the whole deal. it's a strategy sandbox. (my favorite kind). they give us the box, they give us the sand, they give us the toys and we're allowed to get up to all sorts of creative mischief. I love games like this. no cliche cinematic story beats, no A-B progression, no skin-you-alive microtransaction Ubi-Arts horseshit [*at present]. 

I can seriously say I urge absolutely everyone to give this a shot. at launch, ON sale, the price is too generous for what you get for me to be guarded in recommending you try it. (also a seemingly fun, inviting community in what little experience I have with it.)

just try it. if you don't think you'll dig an auto-battler, you never know until you know. I say give it a shot. that's my recommendation.",1

138189609,1559600,"As a lifelong horse game enthusiast, I believe 'The Ranch of Rivershine' gets the genre right. It perfectly captures the old school horse games I grew up with, with borrowed elements from more modern farming simulators, to create a cozy, feel-good game that's delightful to play at any pace.

Bear in mind this is an Early Access game at the time of my writing this review, things will change and improve. Even so, the game is quite fleshed out at the moment. There are bugs, as with every EA release but I have not encountered any that impact my enjoyment of the game, and the developer has been very responsive in stamping those bugs out. 

Currently, the game offers three trails to ride in, along with the ranch and town. These areas are quite lovely to explore. The game also features an auction house with various tiers of horses where you purchase and sell your horses by bidding on them; more rare horses have higher stats and rare coat patterns. The main activity of the game are the cross country competitions, and horse training, but there is also horse care, farming, and breeding and raising foals. There are also quite a few quests that teach you how to play the game and introduce you the story and it's charming characters.

The story is simple - the town of Rivershine used to have a famous championship rider, which brought success to the town, but no longer. It's up to you to bring fame to the town once again by winning cross country competitions with your horses. As you do you attract more vendors and characters to the town, unlocking new trails, better horses to buy, and expansions for your ranch. The game gives you a lot of freedom in how exactly you improve your herd of horses. You can train them, make money and buy better horses, or breed and raise foals with better stats (the breeding in particular is very fun and rewarding). No one approach is better than the other, and you can play the game at any pace you like. Even when struggling to win certain competitions, I was never frustrated, as there was always a way to either train my horse or get horse with better stats. The game also has changing seasons, which makes the landscape fun to re-explore and effects your farming.

My only criticism would be that the game could benefit from more variety in the day-to-day activities. You spend most of your days racing and training, and while these are very fun, it can get a bit grindy if they're the only things you're focused on. Given that this game is still Early Access, I believe these improvements will come eventually, especially looking at what the developer has planned.

I think the best part of the game are the horses themselves. Charming animations and small details make Rivershine's horses really feel like animals, rather than vehicles you need to occasionally feed and brush. I feel like so many horse games forget this. Rivershine gets it right. The horses nicker 'hello' when you enter the stable, will follow you around the pasture if you have enough trust with them, turn their head to look at you, the foals even follow their mother around. Your horses grow and improve in their skills alongside you, as you improve at the game. The horses are so adorable you just have to stop every once in a while to gush over them.

Overall, 'The Ranch of Rivershine' is a breath of fresh air in the horse game genre, and I think it brings quite a few interesting elements to the farming/ranch sim genre as well. Its leisurely pace, cute graphics, wonderful music and open-ended quests make for a perfect game to chill out too. There's clearly been a lot of care and love put into this game that horse game enthusiasts like myself will appreciate. If you're a horse game fan, or just looking for a feel-good cozy game, I recommend giving 'The Ranch of Rivershine' a look!",1

[b]No builds, no variety, no rewards[/b]
Now... let me explain a bit about the gameplay. DD1 was very grindy, you need to build up your squads, level them up to dungeons, and keep on recruiting new mercenaries of different classes. You probably have your A team, B team and so on. When your squad gets wiped out, it pains you because you have build them up with so much effort. 

Here, there is no such grind, which sounds good but not. Essentially, all squad members have 0 individuality because you can't recruit 2 of the same class. So you actually go through 5 Locations, and each locations have 4 stages, each stage being multiple branching roads and a mini boss and a big boss, so there's about 20 stages total. In every stage, you kill monsters, get trinkets/equipments, and probably unlock new skills, there is a slight levelling up of your skill, but every skill can only be levelled once. And after you beat the stage boss you go the next stage right?

..... Here's the HUGEEEEEE problem, everytime you go to the next stage, ALL YOUR UPGRADES reset, your trinkets, your coach upgrades, your currencies, your whole inventory and even your skill upgrades. You even select your party members once more, which you can select the same one or different, but what's even the point? You can only run a single squad, so if you have run successfully with your previous squad you'll probably run with them again. So essentially, you are not building up anything at all, there is no special builds or lucky builds, you don't keep anything, zero. You play thru 20 bloody stages all like that, there is zero long term planning, zero variety.

In DD1, you start with a huntsman called Dismas and a knight called Reinard, if you manage to beat the final dungeon with both of them alive, you actually get an achievement for that. It's somewhat nice because they become special and you want to make sure they level up and survive, you feel an attachment to these characters at the end, and there's none of that at all in DD2. 

The stages also have 0 differences and variety in enemies and traps etc, because there is no way you can plan for them. in DD1, the cove have their own unique dangers and tricks, once you learn what they are, then you can plan your expedition with your B team (because your A team is all hospitalized lol) and come out victorious. 

Here it doesn't matter if your squad members die, you just need to make it to the end of the stage, then you can recruit a new member..., which can be the same member that just died, and because nothing carries over, they are essentially the same.

[b]Artificial Difficulty [/b]
So having zero needs to level up and build different parties, what do they do to make this game difficult? By adding weird nonsensical mechanics. Now, you cannot heal just because you have the skill or healing item, healing have a requirements of your hp dropping below usually 25% before you can do it, and then the healing skill has a 2 turns cooldown, so now they classify healing as a very strict & limited skill, which makes the Vestal class absolutely useless. If you are going to be so stingy, why not remove it altogether? There are other methods of healing but in essence, there is no such thing as a healer class now, healing is an unreliable skill.

What's worse is actually the ""stress system"", in DD1 if your stress hit the limit, you either get a random negative effect or positive one, and if you get negative one and you hit your maximum stress meter again, you die of heart attack, which kinda make sense. 
Now in DD2, once you hit max stress, you get either a ""Meltdown"" or a ""Resolute"" result, Resolute is easy, your stress meter goes 0, and i think you get a bit of health..... But if you get a Meltdown, you will lose about 90% of your hp immediately, and you team mates also increase their stress, so something like from 60hp to 4hp. This is what kills you usually, no enemies will hit you as hard as stress, so you might have a full healthy squad, then someone gets max stress, and their stress causes the others to get max stress too, then your healthy party all ends up on deaths door, and gets wiped out with a measly aoe on next turn. It's ridiculous. 

[h1]SUMMARY [/h1]

I could go on about why a lot of design decisions are stupid, but i'll just stop here. In short, it looks much nicer, but everything that makes DD1 charming is not present here, there is nothing of substance at all. I have over 120 hours in DD1, but I'm done here, I don't feel like playing this a 2nd time, there's absolutely 0 replayability in DD2. Save your time and money.",0

138191114,1159690,"The sheer amount of grind wouldnt be as devastating to me, if it werent for the fact, that it is just... so... damn... boring to do. 

Dont get me wrong, its fun for like a couple of hours, but the game doesnt provide you with helpfull instruments to make it easier as the game progresses. It doesnt help, that the crafting system is getting more and more exhausting as you progress further. 

Crafting system explained:
You basically got 3 main crafting resources. 
- With them you craft different kinds of crafting stations in order to get new crafting options. 
- Through the stations you craft different types of materials out of the 3 original ones. 
- The new materials are then needed to craft better versions of the old crafting stations.
- And so it goes on...

the better versions tho are no direct upgrade that provides you with both new and old recipes. No, it just gives you new ones, so you still need to keep all the old stations in order to craft everything else.

The result is you constantly running between 9 different stations in order to get one material you need. To be able to craft you mostly need fuel for your stations, that you need to farm as well. Manually.

A quick example. Lets say I want to get a chest type 1. First i need to farm the necessary resources. That takes about 2-3 minutes. Then you need to process. Luckily its just a type 1 chest so you just need to run between 3 different crafting stations in order to get the job done. That shouldnt take longer than 2 minutes.
So after 4-5 minutes you got ONE chest.
Have fun building a train.

Note: The game has potential, the combat is fairly fun and the concept is neat. In the current state tho I cant recomment to buy the game unless its 50% off. Core gameplay improvements are heavily needed in order to play it long term.

The game is not finished, I think it is far away from that. This is a point for the studio and developers, there is ton of work ahead of you.

I have started with Campaign and got bored, so I understand negative reviews on that front, however maybe they are not fair as it is only small part of the game. 
Once you will move to Free Play it is where the fun begins from my point of view.
The game is not easy, you need to be patient but after a while it will give you a lot of joy, I am sure of that.

Give it a chance, it is $20 or so for the best living on Mars simulation out there.",1
138190388,758690,"This review is during the first few days.  I have played the game in the evenings and today while I am off of work.  

Take it for what you will. 

I did beta testing, played the demo etc... this EA version is so much better than all that have come before it, it is much more functional and more enjoyable.  I was annoyed with the other mode because you were limited in what you could do.  In this you have access to many features and you have to work your way to acquire them.  I find myself wishing I could load in a multiplayer team and knock stuff out which is a good sign compared to just saving and quitting the game for months like before.  Instead I have played it the last several days and look forward to continuing.   

The massive terrain system is amazing, it is endless.  There is plenty of places to salvage although it seems unrealistic in a way because... why are  there so many bases on a deserted planet?  Its almost like pop up tribes, but how did they get there?  

Major Pro - The developer is responsive to complains - albeit they are a small team and slow to act on some things.  Some things they seem to ignore because they want things a certain way which is understandable... but in some instances I feel should be more adaptable. 

Major Con - You die a lot for stupid reasons.  I have no doubt they will fix this, but man... I was doing stuff for an hour and it didnt autosave...  when I died because of my atv and realized how far back I had gone I was cussing like a sailor.  

I highly encourage them work on a temporary autosave system that autosaves the games every 5 minutes into a temporary location for up to 5 saves so you can choose where to go back to and also so that it does not overwrite your save file. 

Overall, I am happy to have purchased and supported this game.  I look forward to its future development. I also hope people who have only played for .3 hours quit lying on some of these reviews... you cannot even play the game for that amount of time and accomplish what they have said they accomplished.  Its obious lying.   I am biased because I supported the game early on, but I also have been disappointed MANY times along the way.  That in my opinion makes me a critic, and take my advice, if you want a casual game to play then this is it.  Does it have a ways to go... yes... absolutely yes.  Do I think they developers will continue development of this game?  yes.  

So overall.  It was a good purchase.  I am hoping it becomes my new ARK Survival replacement.  I play FPS games now because I didnt want a super addicting game like ARK... really hoping this is it.

138188953,758690,"I am saddened by the flood of instant negative reviews for this game posted before giving the developers a chance to respond.  Personally, I ignored the reviews, bought the game and really enjoying it.  It has worked brilliantly.  Yes, it does have a challenge to fully understand it but they warn you it is a game to offer challenges and that should be a positive feature,  Well done to the developers; three updates already, addressing issues as they arise.  This is an early access game, issues are to be expected but this team of developers are indeed very responsive.",1
138188923,758690,"Definitely not a recommendation, but I don't want to dogpile on the game.
Would highly suggest the developers to check out Stationeers, Astroneer and Planet Crafter, as the game seems to be sitting somewhere in-between. 

The balancing here is pretty bad - it feels like the early-game is artificially drawn-out as to stretch the available content. At the same time, it doesn't seem that the game is completely lacking of content, so why make the player waste so much time driving a half-broken ATV to grab 1 item every 10-20 minutes, while risking their lives (and patience) to do so?
Also, why does this single-player game locks so much progression over slow ""experience"" bars?

Mining is also slow and manages to be slower than hand-mining in Space Engineers. This indicates to me some sort of disconnect between design choices of making a slower/hardcore game (Stationeers) or a faster/arcadey one (Planet Crafter).

There's a reasonably large team and likely a reasonable large budget going on here, therefore the expectations would be high. I don't blame the people who are Not Recommending this right at the day of the Early Access release, especially considering the overall context of this game's niche.

It's better to decide early on whether the game will be more casual or more hardcore, and stick to it. Value what your playtesters are saying, and don't make fundamental changes to the experience before trying it out first. With the limited information I have, I believe the player started with a better/faster vehicle before, and this was removed prior to the Early Access release.

After 5 hours of playing this, I have 6 solar panels, a couple electrical equipment, and a ""functional"" hab (it has air in it, and potatoes). That's it. I can't even make my own ""Crafting Table"" (Printer) or even my own bed, because that requires me to spend hours crawling in the Martian sand taking damage to find a single item that will unlock 5-10 more minutes of actual content. 

Comparing this to the experiences provided by similar games made by smaller teams and budgets, and one is truly stretching their luck releasing on such a state. I'm not even mentioning the issues brought up by other people, I'm only focusing on the balancing aspect.

The performance issues should probably be looked at over time, and I'd recommend a graphics overhaul as well - a lot of models and textures here look strange or very dated, while others look better.
The ""escape the explody space station"" section seriously need to be looked at and reworked, at least adding waypoints. The current campaign is pretty questionable - would have been better to keep it locked and only include the tutorials and free play.

Despite the jankiness and jerkiness of character movement and animations, if truly cared for and worked on, this could become a fun game on the ""space survival"" genre - especially if it does involve creating a liveable habitat and a working colony for actual AI colonists to do stuff in.
I don't believe just building on what is available is enough for this to revert into a positively reviewed game, however. Reworks and rethinks will definitely need to be made, and not every game can go through that.",1

138189727,1972050,"I know I'm not that far in yet, but I've made it to the first weekend.

I am not typically one for dating sims, but this game has a lot of heart. You can tell that from the writing and storytelling, graphics and design, and music atmosphere that this was a labor of love from start to finish. 

As someone who was in the pit in marching band my freshman year, and then transitioned to bass drum, I really wanted to like Doug, but I found myself drawn a lot more to Sam's calmness and Garth's fun loving, yet ambitious spirit. There's a lot of great references that anyone who has attended band camp will understand, recognize, and be able to connect with on a personal level. All of the characters have such human qualities and characteristics. You want to get to know them better and ask the right questions!

The only critiques I have are those that would probably be fixed with a larger budget. I'd like more voiceover of the conversations, but the work that has been done is well executed and is sprinkled in just enough to keep your imagination engaged while pushing the story forward. It may even be purposeful, but I'm newer to the genre.

Make sure you save your progress as you go, and don't be afraid to let your heart guide you! You'll have fun and be glad you did.

138189483,669330,"I say that something like this needs to be seen and experienced by everyone interested in trying new video games. give it a shot. an auto-battler as a concept might seem boring to some, but it interested me - I've never tried one before. the hook is that you can't move your units once they're set, you can only move the units you just put down, then THEY'RE locked into place . . . so each match you're constantly updating and (hopefully) complimenting those first unit / placement tactics you set . . . which makes every decision important, meaning one misplaced unit could well be it (and one WELL-placed unit can mean your victory). it's a constantly updating game of Rock / Paper / Scissors (or Bot / Plane / Lasers, as it were). a great concept with tight visuals and interface. 

as for the learning curve, I don't see it as PUNISHING I see it as PUSHING us to learn and adapt from past mistakes. be vigilant, study up what units do what . . . smart people like yourselves can absolutely do it. 

and since it's priced at what, 15 dollars? pft. I can totally see people getting thousands and thousands of hours from this if they keep up with their community's thoughts and wishes WHILE not giving them absolutely everything they want. (in my experience we rarely know what we ACTUALLY want; maybe especially in video games). 

and keep it sharp! keep the edge! the fact you can totally blow a match in devastating, humiliating failure means you burn those lessons hard into the minds of new players (like me). I have no idea if I'll play this for another hour or another hundred hours. I've already gotten my money's worth just by experiencing something so confident, new and deceptively deep. 

btw; single player IS a thing -- there are AI Skirmishes, Practice Grounds, Training Grounds, Challenges, the whole deal. it's a strategy sandbox. (my favorite kind). they give us the box, they give us the sand, they give us the toys and we're allowed to get up to all sorts of creative mischief. I love games like this. no cliche cinematic story beats, no A-B progression, no skin-you-alive microtransaction Ubi-Arts horseshit [*at present]. 

I can seriously say I urge absolutely everyone to give this a shot. at launch, ON sale, the price is too generous for what you get for me to be guarded in recommending you try it. (also a seemingly fun, inviting community in what little experience I have with it.)

just try it. if you don't think you'll dig an auto-battler, you never know until you know. I say give it a shot. that's my recommendation.",1

138189609,1559600,"As a lifelong horse game enthusiast, I believe 'The Ranch of Rivershine' gets the genre right. It perfectly captures the old school horse games I grew up with, with borrowed elements from more modern farming simulators, to create a cozy, feel-good game that's delightful to play at any pace.

Bear in mind this is an Early Access game at the time of my writing this review, things will change and improve. Even so, the game is quite fleshed out at the moment. There are bugs, as with every EA release but I have not encountered any that impact my enjoyment of the game, and the developer has been very responsive in stamping those bugs out. 

Currently, the game offers three trails to ride in, along with the ranch and town. These areas are quite lovely to explore. The game also features an auction house with various tiers of horses where you purchase and sell your horses by bidding on them; more rare horses have higher stats and rare coat patterns. The main activity of the game are the cross country competitions, and horse training, but there is also horse care, farming, and breeding and raising foals. There are also quite a few quests that teach you how to play the game and introduce you the story and it's charming characters.

The story is simple - the town of Rivershine used to have a famous championship rider, which brought success to the town, but no longer. It's up to you to bring fame to the town once again by winning cross country competitions with your horses. As you do you attract more vendors and characters to the town, unlocking new trails, better horses to buy, and expansions for your ranch. The game gives you a lot of freedom in how exactly you improve your herd of horses. You can train them, make money and buy better horses, or breed and raise foals with better stats (the breeding in particular is very fun and rewarding). No one approach is better than the other, and you can play the game at any pace you like. Even when struggling to win certain competitions, I was never frustrated, as there was always a way to either train my horse or get horse with better stats. The game also has changing seasons, which makes the landscape fun to re-explore and effects your farming.

My only criticism would be that the game could benefit from more variety in the day-to-day activities. You spend most of your days racing and training, and while these are very fun, it can get a bit grindy if they're the only things you're focused on. Given that this game is still Early Access, I believe these improvements will come eventually, especially looking at what the developer has planned.

I think the best part of the game are the horses themselves. Charming animations and small details make Rivershine's horses really feel like animals, rather than vehicles you need to occasionally feed and brush. I feel like so many horse games forget this. Rivershine gets it right. The horses nicker 'hello' when you enter the stable, will follow you around the pasture if you have enough trust with them, turn their head to look at you, the foals even follow their mother around. Your horses grow and improve in their skills alongside you, as you improve at the game. The horses are so adorable you just have to stop every once in a while to gush over them.

Overall, 'The Ranch of Rivershine' is a breath of fresh air in the horse game genre, and I think it brings quite a few interesting elements to the farming/ranch sim genre as well. Its leisurely pace, cute graphics, wonderful music and open-ended quests make for a perfect game to chill out too. There's clearly been a lot of care and love put into this game that horse game enthusiasts like myself will appreciate. If you're a horse game fan, or just looking for a feel-good cozy game, I recommend giving 'The Ranch of Rivershine' a look!",1

Like when you set up a large scale attack you cant just take charge of the lead unit. When you switch to infantry you have to gear up then teleport to the battlefield. By then the battle could have been decided by then or worse the AI diverted or redirected the attack. A zoom for all weapons and vehicles would be nice. Defensive structures. It would also help with coordination by giving basic AI commands such as telling other units to follow you or hold ground from the infantry point of view. Personnel Carriers or troop transports would be keep the infantry with the faster units. Can't wait to see what they add in the next updates

Scale is off just enough to be noticeable, all the zombies are 10% larger than they feel like they should be, while things like a city street are smaller than they should be (similar in style to a Bethesda game). In VR it's very noticeable. The text on the tutorial wouldn't go away and kept overlaying the text for the next part until it was impossible to read or continue. Had to hard restart the game. The player in the Host position will always be a black. I've seen every asset in this game somewhere else, not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but just something to point out.

138193096,1940340,Rare instance that sequel captures the same feeling as the original but provides a drastically different game experience. Love it.,1
138192687,1940340,"Darkest Dungeon 2 is different from the first one, and that's absolutely fine, it now doesn't feel like a chore trying to finish your run in 200+ hours anymore and dropping it somewhere in the middle because of how terrible the grind and leveling up new heroes once was. I know I didn't. It now leans into a more rogue-lite experience, focused less on the long-term management, and more about the immediate choices and battles you're going to fight.

First of all, absolutely loving how they took the best aspects of the combat from the first DD and adjusted it for the token usage, which should've made it less random, but... It's still a percentage based game, so... 
I feel as if some aspects should be tweaked a little (for example, a random crit independent from the token SHOULD outright execute an enemy by a logic of game design, right?), And my only gripe with combat system is sometimes the damage on abilities feel not that impactful  (sometimes even when setting up a combo) compared to their counterparts of DD1 and more often than not heroes tend to land the lowest damage number. 

Then we get into the progression of the game...

Remember that the game is meant to be more chore-free?
Although the current progression system is nice and offers a lot of upgrades and unlocks, (better than the level-based one was when the game was in Epic Games, anyways) I feel like the candles should either drop in bigger quantities, or at the very least adjusted somehow, either by number of slain enemies, visiting the nodes on the map or time spent on the expedition. There is a way to earn them with hero quests, however.
The quests that heroes have are rather... Situational. You're encouraged to finish these in order to get more candles and upgrade your heroes/loot table/etc, but it somewhat changes the way you're playing: it's no longer about weighing whether it's risky or not going for a boss encounter, it's more like ""well, I will get more candles this way, so I might as well try"", or stalling the combat so that specific hero would land a finishing blow on someone or use an ability x amount of times. Feels counter intuitive to a genre. 
Not to mention, if a quest is about using a specific combat item and you don't find it in the inn... Well, you're out of luck. Then there's the Bounty Hunter fee as well...

Right now, the ratio of candles rewarded for the time & effort invested in a run doesn't feel as rewarding. I don't really feel encouraged to try and invest time into another run that's going to reward the same amount of candles as the last time, perhaps even less. 

Speaking of situational, I feel as if some of the features were better suited for the first game. For example, ever since the game released in early access, I couldn't care less about the hero quirks, nor the academic studies that might reward these. I barely even check them, because they feel so... useless, overall. In the first game you could plan ahead and invest, using specific heroes for specific areas and purposes, and here it's just... Well, they're there. Why should I care if I get Tangle Tactician in Sprawl on the last region before the Mountain? Hospitals feel like a waste of time too, because more often than not you don't even have money to reinforce/remove the quirk, as most of the currency goes out the window in the inn. 

Trinkets are... Questionable, at best. There are trinkets that give a somewhat decent buff with a great tradeoff, but more often than not I stumble upon the one that is either extremely situational and doesn't benefit me at all, or just plain ""Why would I ever want to use this?"" material. Not all of them are terrible, however. 

At the end of the day, it's still Darkest Dungeon. It still has it's ""Darkest Dungeon"" moments. And that's the beauty of it, I guess. Pretty much a staple of roguelike genre. Although in the case of DD2 I'm more inclined to think that there's still a big room for improvements and re-balancing, and I hope Red Hook will figure things out.",1
138192448,1940340,Great game so far!,1
138192444,1940340,"Way too easy, compared to the first one. Its just a global trend in modern gamedev to make games more casual. Kinda disappointed, honestly. Still, decent game",1
138192359,1940340,"There are a few unpolished pieces of it, but ultimately I am having a lot of fun playing it. Very different from the first game, that's ok. Token system is a significant improvement. 8.5/10",1
138192144,1940340,"Quick summary. Not like darkest dungeon 1. Very mediocre generic roguelike(lite?) based around turn based combat with few rpg elements. Very high price for what doesn't amount to much variety. Red Hook Studios did some greedy things to produce this. If morals or money isn't an issue its an average roguelike(lite) in a sea of other cheaper similar options. Best bet is to wait until they release the ultimate edition down the road and get everything the game has to offer for less than they are charging right now. Can't recommend as is.


Red hook got very lucky with how darkest dungeon exploded, and while flawed had a unique feel for an rpg, base building, high depth and difficulty made a difficult turn based rpg feel very rough but not impossible or brutally unfair. Then with mod support and some insanely talented steam workshop modders (one or two of which I believe now work for Red Hook, how cool is that?), the game truly ascended to an all time great. Then they abandoned steam to take epics money get feedback from the mouth breathers that use that poop show, and came up with the most uninspired average experience I've had in awhile, and charge twice to three times as much as other games in the genre. The game looks great, the ost didnt do anything for me and the narrator even feels like it lost a tiny bit of that spark of greatness. The grind is long but content doesn't last as long as the grind at the moment. With 21 hours and using google to figure out the bosses one trick to save myself redoing a 3 hour run I have beaten all of the content. All that is left is to grind runs to get the optional hard mode item and do it all again. If you are desperate for solid turn based content and not too worried about much else its an ok buy. if anything else worth waiting on.",0
138191847,1940340,"I am recommending this game for anyone not too committed to the DD1 game mechanics and loop.  DD2 moves away from many of the RPG and party recruitment and management mechanics of DD1.  DD2 adopts features and gameplay mechanics more roguelike in many respects.  It removes the recruitment of new characters and the town setting where characters are trained, equipped and upgraded.

I was at first not especially happy with the change but now I find this to have removed much of the grind associated with character development in DD1.  So much time had to be invested in DD1 to recruit, level up, equip and upgrade multiple teams that it became a mechanic in DD1 that I didn't particularly enjoy.  DD2 removes much of the ""administrative burden"" of DD1 and focuses on the gameplay and character progression.  

DD2 still has all of the lore and mystery, the combat mechanics of DD1 and new character progression dynamics.  The new mechanics allow you to move the story and progression along faster and without the frustrations of building and maintaining multiple teams of characters.  DD2 made me realize that I didn't like DD1 as much as I thought.  But, I still really love DD1.

In closing, I think DD2 is a great game and I'm enjoying it a lot.  It's not the same game as DD1 and it doesn't have to be for me to have great fun with it.  I can love both games and that's okay.",1

138226777,1940340,"I must admit that it takes a while to loved Darkest Dungeon 2. First, because it's very different than the predecessor and i'm almost quit this game around first 8 hours playing because it's so different and worsed (in my first impression) than what i've expected. But suprisingly, around 18 and 20 hours later, I found that this game is STILL A DARKEST DUNGEON because of how they capture the Cosmic Horror, the athmostphere, the long trip journey and the desperate moment when your team become disfunction and hate each other and resources become so scarce that you there's no hope to continue the expedition.

I think this is an organic evolution of Darkest Dungeon because in the first game, there is hamlet and a mansion, then in the second game, the world is in going to end and there is no city left except the three city and an Inn so we left to journey in the dark and desperate world.

[h1] Future Improvement [/h1]
And with Darkest Dungeon 2, i see that there is so many room to improved in the future: 
1. Like more regions, more enemies and mini bosses, 
2. I wish that my team that previously survived in the Chapter 1 and 2 can still be bought to Chapter 3 and so forth until the conclusion of this story. 
3. Maybe there is an improvement like Side Quest when we're in the Inn like we're doing a hunt or bounty, like a mini journey or a small maps (different than the main routes) that lead to a mini boss fight.
4. Maybe we can choose a members in the Inn when one of our teammates died because random member placement is breaking the strategy that player choose (Or maybe this is what the developer is intended).
5. Then maybe there is story improvement about many lore that we've not knowing about The Inn, The Mountain, and the other team members in Darkest Dungeon 1. The Inn is very intriquing because it's the last human base that still stand in the end of the world so maybe there is something about the inn.
6. The regions in darkest dungeon doesn't feel so connected so we doesn't feel like we're going deeper into the mountain, it's like we're just running around and then go to the mountain, not like we're going deeper in the jungle, so maybe there is more improvement in there.
7. Wish there is more interaction and morale decission.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
I respect the decision that Red Hook has taken in this sequel because in modern game, there is not many developer that want to create something different in their sequel. And as a player and consumer, i think they have done a lot of passion in this game. Darkest Dungeon 1 has become a cult classic, [u] and if Red Hook really want to make Darkest Dungeon 2 a different classic roguelike, actually THEY CAN MAKE IT [/u]  because the room for improvement is so large in Darkest Dungeon 2. 

I know this game is still not perfect, but i trust Red Hook and their passion! And i wish Darkest Dungeon 2 could become a Classic Roguelike. 
If you like Cosmic Horror, solid roguelike, buddy travelling game, Gothic Horror and Lovecraftian, this is one of the best game for Lovecraft fans!",1
138226641,1940340,"It's different but same same from its predecessor in the best ways. 100% a great sequel. The combat largely remains the same (which is the ENTIRE point of this game anyway, so cheers), however this somehow feels as if it is more true to being a ""roguelike"" than the last. 

Again, still feels largely the same and overall very fun to play. It maintains the difficulty (you will suffer much disappointment in the first few tries, this is normal) however I would argue that this one feels slightly more friendly in the long run. Because now you do have a means to start new runs with increasingly better circumstances, so you CAN prevail. Eventually. 

P.S. By the way, this one LOOKS fantastic! They kept the same art style, but animated everything just a little bit more. It turned out very cool.",1

138226068,1924170,"This is undoubtedly the best motorbike racing game out there! 
Finally, the TT series has received a boost in overall quality and, most importantly, in terms of the physics! The bike is extremely ""physical"", perfectly planted on the surface and with a completely revised weight system that significantly influences its leaning, which is now much more solid and structured than in the past. Now, each model requires a REAL different approach to driving, and I find it incredibly stimulating to have to learn the different motorbike models and understand their qualities and weaknesses to tackle the roads proposed by the game! 

The career is certainly long and complex to deal with, and perhaps some challenges are too demanding, but the open road feature is an interesting first approach for a change of direction in the world of motorbike games.

On the technical side, the game is not perfect, it's true. Although graphically the game is superior to previous chapters, I expected a slightly different quality and, above all, greater precision in the rendering of some views of the island and the road sections. On the other hand, some areas of the Isle of Man are completely new and reproduced extremely faithfully, fantastic to ride at high speeds with your bikes, and this is a great added value!",1

And the farming aspect is done perfectly and you don't have to plant but it does make things easier and helps make money.

Only ""complaint"" is in the canter animation the shoulder of the horse snaps a bit when moving, but its not annoying and doesn't bother me much. (Its only the Early Access so I wouldn't expect it to perfect). I haven't encountered any bugs/glitches yet.

138226994,2169830,"Gotta say, really enjoying this game so far. There's skills you can rank up between maps which feel like they have an actual impact on the gameplay. There is no actual ""Combat"" in this game, rather it's a wait and chill kind of game. You build buildings, they generate resources, you spend those resources on troops and more buildings. Defeat the enemy armies as they approach, rinse and repeat.

The story is very bare-bones, more as a vehicle to get you from Waifu A to Waifu B than any real narrative progression. Which is honestly fine for the price tag considering the quality art and animations in the game.

The game slowly introduces more buildings to use as you go throughout the game, at a rate of about one new building per level. But at its core it's a nice chill game that requires just enough thinking to progress or you could end up failing the mission. Missions are nice 10-15 minute chunks. I can also tell some thought went into actually balancing the gameplay, as more than once I found myself racing against the clock to pass the stage. 

If you're here for the Adult content, there's a patch on the creators website you can download. You only need to use one of the links. If you speak English like me, the first link is what you want.

On that note, translation isn't bad. While there are a few mistakes here and there, there is not enough to detract from your enjoyment of the game or enough to make it difficult to understand what's going on. All that being said, this isn't a game I would pick up if I wasn't interested in the Adult content. While the writing can be enough to get a chuckle out of you at times and the gameplay interesting enough to keep you from falling asleep in your chair, there's not much else going on for this game other than the adult content. Which, to be fair, is pretty short, but decent. Since everything is animated, it's a nice bonus. 

Overall, pick it up. Support the Dev. Hope to see more from them going forward. At $14 the game is no Hollow Knight but in the land of poor quality H Games we inhabit this has just enough quality going for it that a degenerate like you and me can have fun with it.",1

138227564,1940340,"This game feels like a rehash of the first one with a substantial amount of gameplay differences. The characters in this one don't permanently die, instead they are available again once your mission is over whether they died on the mission or not. This game gives each of the characters a cryptic backstory on how they ended up who they are, which is nice. I could get into the specific details of gameplay differences but there's so many and it'd be hard to explain them sufficiently without making this a page long review. As someone who has 300 hours in the first game, I do enjoy this one, but I will say I wish they had come up with new characters. All but one of the heroes is from the first game. The atmosphere is the same as the first game, but the story isn't quite the same. There is a lot of similarity between the ""dungeons"" in this game and the dungeons in the first one; ie the pigpen dungeon, the coastal dungeon, and the forest dungeon, etc. They aren't the exact same, but you definitely feel the familiarity when going through them.

I think this game would have been a lot better if they had made a completely new hero roster. Playing through it just gives me a weird feeling that the creators are viewing the first game like it was an incomplete project and this is their attempt at revisiting and polishing it up, which doesn't make sense to me because the first game was amazing. I like the gameplay mechanics of both games for their own uniqueness, and I do feel like they did an excellent job with the mechanics of this one. If they make another game, which I would love to see, I hope they create new characters. The story was familiar but 'different enough' for me, and I like that they kept the same dark/bleak atmosphere. Other than that, the music is great, it's an easy game to get lost in for hours at a time, and there is a lot of repetitive grinding like the first game.

138230339,1940340,"It’s a very different game from the first, but I think it stands very strongly under it’s own merits. 

The new rougelike systems allows for losses to not feel as demotivating as they were in the first game (in which a loss of a single hour represented a lot of grinding going down the drain), while still keeping combat as intensive and tricky. Changes to the combat system does take some time to get used to (it is VERY important to use the combat items + make use of the buffs and debuffs), but I think on the whole the changes make for a more open-ended systems that encourages creativity. Likewise, the series signature art style is super polished and as always the narrator and music are exquisite. 

I do think maybe the game doesn’t do a great job at explaining itself in places; because of all the symbols in the trinkets/combos/etc it can take a while to wrap your head around what exactly something does, and there is the fact that a lot of the game is based on RNG, and thus there will be times where it feels like the game is kind of just kicking you when your down. I think you’re given enough options that you can avoid the worst of this, but it will be a hill to climb over. 

TLDR: if you like rougelike games, this will likely provide a fresh and polished take on the genre, but if you’re already not a fan of the genre it won’t do anything to convince you otherwise*

Was initially abit disappointed when this game was released as an Early Access, as it meant I wouldn't be able to experience the full story on my first playthrough. However, the first 10mins blew me away with the hyperrealistic graphics. The story builds itself without having to read endless long notes, and you don't get the typical walking simulator horror game style, or endless puzzle solving, the rare jumpscares got me real good. If, like me, you hate horror games that gives you anxiety purely by having someone chasing you again and again and AGAIN, this game is going to be good. 

What i think could make this game a rockstar would be a good voiceover, it will definitely bring it up a notch to match the realistic graphics. Some parts are abit raw, but no game-crashing glitches whatsoever even when I played it on release day. Love the multiple endings which are not differentiated just by slight differences in text or graphics but opens more gameplay.

Super Bear: Hunt for the lost beer is an action 3D fighter developed by Valkeala Softwares and Tero Lunkka.

[h1] Gameplay / Story [/h1]

Always wanted to be a bear? Then please continue, because the game here could be something for you. Our main character is an unknown/young hero chosen to save the world. But everything from the beginning now: As we know it from Winnie Pooh, this one likes to eat honey from the pot, but in this game our hero likes beer. Yes, you've read that correctly. One day his supply was stolen and we find this anything but funny and go in search of the lost bottles.. At the end of each level we fight against a boss and if you defeat him you get a reward (you can guess 3 times what is it). The lost beers, of course. The gameplay is easy to handle and kept simple. We slice our way through various hordes of enemies in hack and slash style, get new, more powerful weapons and occasionally use a medication kit until we reach the boss.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Super Bear: Hunt for the lost beer offers you a slash through different enemy types, which is fun but becomes monotonous after a while. Would buy the game on sale.

[h1][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/26335619-Adult-World-Gamers/] First of all, thanks to the developer for providing us with this key for the group. You can find more good reviews from others and me here and if you liked the review then we would appreciate a thumbs up. [/url][/h1]


[h1] Information / Review Deutsch [/h1]

Super Bear: Hunt for the lost beer ist ein Action 3D-Fighter, welches von Valkeala Softwares und Tero Lunkka entwickelt wurde. 

[h1] Gameplay / Geschichte [/h1]

Du wolltest schon immer mal ein Bär sein ? Dann ließ bitte weiter, den das Spiel hier könnte was für dich sein. Unser Hauptcharakter ist ein unbekannter/junger Held, welcher auserkoren wurde die Welt zu retten. Aber alles von vorne nun: Wie wir es von Winnie Pooh kennen, mag dieser Honig aus dem Topf gerne essen, in diesem Spiel aber mag unser Held  Bier. Ja, du hast richtig gelesen. Eines Tages wurden dessen Vorrat geklaut und wir empfinden dies alles andere als Lustig und machen uns auf die suche nach den verlorenen Flaschen.. Am Ende jedes Levels kämpfen wir gegen einen Boss und wenn du diesen besiegst, erhälst du eine Belohnung (3x darfst du raten was es ist). Natürlich die verlorenen Biere. Das Gameplay geht gut von der Hand und ist einfacht gehalten. Wir schnetzeln uns durch verschiedene Gegnerhorden in Hack and Slash Manier, bekommen neue stärkere Waffen und benutzen auch ab und an ein Medikamentenkit bis wir den Boss erreichen. 

[h1] Pro [/h1]

+ Bär mal anders
+ mehrere Gegnerarten
+ verschiedene Waffenarten 
+ Grafik ist stimmig und bunt
+ stimmungsvolle Musikuntermalung
+ gute Steuerung
+ passendes Preis/Leistungsverhältnis
+ Errungenschaften

[h1] Kontra [/h1]

- kein Widerspielwert auf Dauer

[h1] Fazit [/h1]

Super Bear: Hunt for the lost beer bietet dir eine Schnetzelei durch verschiedene Gegnerarten, welche spaßig ist, aber auf die Dauer eintönig wird. Würde das Spiel im Sale kaufen.

138230224,758690,"Early access version .119.4

Short version is I have enjoyed the 20+ hours I've played since launch. Now to the details.

This is a technical/complex game that will only get more so as it moves through EA. This is *not* a rub 5 stones and 2 sticks together to make a mud hut type of survival game. It took me about an hour to sort out how the power controls and such worked together. There is a nice system of logic behind the controls/power/water etc but it certainly took some plugging/unplugging stuff to figure it out. For being so early on in EA (or imo beta build) it seems well built and fairly fleshed out as far as buildings being ingame, models working etc.
The loading screen states this is an EA game with bugs...if you don't like such things, I dunno what to say.
In 20+ hours I've only encountered 1 or 2 game breaking bugs that were resolved by rolling back to an earlier save, I think it cost me 2-3h of gameplay total. For me that's totally fine for EA but I know that would bother some people. 
I expect to get another 10-20h of gameplay on the initial release build of EA which I'm on and then return to it as it gets updated. My hope is that they follow the No Mans Sky model of continuing to update the game over time while selling copies to pay for development, NMS turned into a gem of a game. Ocupy Mars is way less buggy and more stable imo and has large potential (not as high a ceiling as NMS) but could be a very very good game once it's out of EA and continuing on.

138231697,855740,"I absolutely love this game! It's fun and relaxing and it actually has an interesting and intriguing story to it. 
Some thoughts I would like to pass on to the Devs... 
First off, well done!! It's brilliant! Might I suggest a player inventory beside the trolley? It's quite annoying to stand in front of a giant rubbish site and taking my finds to the trolley one by one.
Also I think it would be awesome if we could upgrade our trolley and maybe even decorate it? The decorating is not essential, just an idea to make it more personal. 
Then the pigeons, after unlocking the second skill by building a different cage for the birds, I can't seem to select the first skill again, I actually liked the first skill much better but it won't allow me to select it unless I upgrade the first coop I had. There is also a small bug when you hit a car with the trolley, you basically become stuck and no matter how hard you try, the trolley won't move away from the car. I don't know if my force was too strong, but I had ""Fireworks""  strapped to the trolley so i was in a hurry!
Lastly, the Map...I'm big on maps and I would like to know where things are. Few of the points are descriptive on the map, so when I'm looking for my home for the first time, I didn't know what icon i'm searching for. Same with the clown man and where his junkyard is. i would just like a small word of description where the icon is on the map so that I know where to go if I'm looking for something. 
Other than that, great game and I can't wait to see what the future holds for Bum Simulator!!",1
138230023,1978720,"I see a lot of potential in this game, the only problem with it right now is the ui",1
138231776,2271200,"This game is simply astounding!! It delivers a pure, old-style, adrenaline-fueled and merciless first-person shooter experience. From the moment you start playing, you're immediately immersed in a fast-paced and intense campaign that keeps you on the edge of your seat. 

If you expect to beat a level at the first attempt, either you a God of the FPS or you'll be disappointed. Get ready to swear like a sailor and repeat the level dozens of times and get better and better.

Although the graphics is very simple, the art style is good and landscapes are amazing. The sci-fi soundtrack and audio effects greatly compensate for any simplicity in the graphics, demonstrating the meticulous attention that has been put into the game's development.

It's an absolute joy to play for fans of the genre, bringing back that nostalgic feeling of heart-pounding excitement. Overall, this game is an incredible experience that captures the essence of pure, unadulterated FPS action.

The only downside is that it's currently difficult to find other players for the co-op campaign and PvP multiplayer. My review is based solely on the single-player mode. I hope the development continues in this direction and that the future brings even more quality.",1
138232768,2359850,"I have come here to chew bubblegum and shoot pixels. And I'm all out of bubblegum.

138232688,1294810,"Lots to say about this game. I do find it fun but its very unpolished. I think the AI needs some work. So far the Boss's are a bit easy, the humans are like storm troopers ( cant hit you hardly), and the vampires need to be a little harder cause all you have to do is side step them. Also the world is a bit empty at times. I feel like i gotta blow everything up to attract and keep enemies coming. I also think they need to add a bit more to the nest maybe a boss and randomize the nest more by adding more stuff to do in them. I do wish the best for the company and I am really excited to see where the game goes. I love Bethesda but lets be honest they dont have the best track record on releasing games or bugs in current games. (i guess im a fanboy and have alot of patience) Another negative to the game that will improve over time is the Co Op servers are kinda trash atm. (again will get better with time) What i do find to be one of the best parts of the game for me is the amount of detail they put in all the background objects and setting up the houses. I like the skill trees and weapon choices. I am ok with those. Overall i think the game will get alot better overtime.  ATM im playing solo and having a blast with the story. The story for me is really good. It appeals to me and drags me in for more. I did buy a 2nd copy of the game for my wife to try Co Op. At the time of writing this the Co Op servers again wont let us stay connected to play together at all. With that said i can say the game isnt worth 70$ its probably worth more like 25 to 30$ USD atm BUT lets keep it positive and hope  the company pulls out of this and make this a really great game!",1

I would love to see an FPS version of this though :)",1

138233203,1742020," [h1] HELL YES [/h1]

Idol Showdown was not on my radar until it launched and this game has been nothing but surprises.

Great music, characters, and controls  

its roster is unfamiliar to me but the designs are cute and they are more than likely littered with small jokes throughout their Move Lists for those who are.

my favorite is Ayame Nakiri (and yes I only know her as samurai lady) 

But the controls, feel and mechanics need to be good with a splash of uniqueness and this game delivers in spades

Its a 4 button fighter similar to MVC 
light medium Heavy special 
with your normal amount of options within

But the unique element is that the special button depending on the direction can be used as a simple input for other moves. its a great kind of modern control scheme that allows for people to have fun but not hold their had the whole time

A burst mechanic which is fine a little generic but it does its job

the assist/collab mechanic is one of the best takes ive seen for this in a while. 
you think its going to be exactly like Fraymakers but their are changes that make the system feel fun and unique 

The collabs run off of a meter system and have 2 moves that you can use with each character, the attacks that they can do are drastically different one ladies first attack is acorns that float above your head that will eventually hit the opponent the other attack she hits their ass with a fucking delivery truck! 
another pulls out terro card that give the opponents debuffs the assist system is so fun
although the meter fill a little slow the attacks are usually so good that its worth it.

I have one complaint that is small but I think would elevate the game to an even crazier level of crazy (air dashes) its so weird going from other anime fighters to this and not having that iconic air movement but this should definitely not be a turn off to most people 

all in all i really enjoyed my time with this game sadly the online is in beta so I don't want to shit on it to hard 
but without an online mode im probably just going to drop it for strive and not pay attention to it
really good game to bad it came out in one of the biggest fighting game booms in the last 5 years",1
138233138,1742020,"Pretty Decent & Fun fighting game, Feels like a mix between Guilty Gear and SF:TURBO but need a little bit polish

1. The A.I sometimes can strike first before the Match Ready/ Start screen is still present giving them the advantage
2. Maybe Add end match quote/dialogue for the winner?
3. I love the youtube style end match screen. however, i don't think using the actual hololive stream thumbnail fits the overall game aesthetic",1
138232264,1742020,"I'm a hardcore hololive fan, so many times I would even try to escape reality with lucid dreaming, I would be with all the other EN girls where I would often play with Amelia in her streaming room and help Calliope with her songs, but one day as I was talking to Gura, we went to my dormitory for a private talk. She immediately said, ""You know you could live with us forever.."" I gave her a confused look and she continued, ""We understand that you live on earth and you REALLY wish to live here"". I then said ""How.. How did you know?"" She then giggled and said ""Because we've been watching you, silly!""

This was a dream come true and I almost cried right there. She then said, ""I talked with Yagoo and he agreed that you would be PERFECT for Holostars EN, you just have to do...one thing"". She then held my hand and looked deep into my eyes and said ""...You have to kill yourself for the transfer to work correctly."" I then gave her some questions, ""How long do I have before the deal expires?"" She then said ""Yagoo said 3 months.."" I added by saying ""What's the most painless way?..."" She giggled again, ""Suicide will require pain buuut...if you want it quick...Get a gun and a nice shot to the head works.

I then agreed and she gave me a kiss on the forehead, ""I know this will be tough but once it's over and done, you'll get to live here!"" I then woke up and this was last week and i purchased a gun. I might actually kill myself because that dream just felt too real to be fake and my life isn't doing so grand.

so it's written.",1
138231772,1742020,This is like if every move was the chainsaw move,1
138234095,1940340,"REALLY enjoying this game so far, combat is as good as ever and the token system adds a lot more than i initially thought it would, a lot of enemy encounters and bosses are well designed (i especially enjoy the end of act bosses and the shroud boss, though the tangled boss is a bit hit or miss for me) but my biggest issue is that the new character that wasn't in dd1 just feels like a worse version of other characters and i haven't really found a good fit for her yet. a lot of the paths also seem generally useless though i imagine that is to do with my playstyle and others will find uses for them.",1
138234020,1940340,"I just wanna say I really loved DD1 and thought this game would be a nice sequel. It is not. It's been more than 1 year of early access and I cant (for the life of me) figure out how no one noticed how many holes this game has:

The good:
-Art is awesome.
-Soundtrack is awesome.
-Relationship mechanic is an interestic idea (even if too RNG dependant for my taste).
-Animations for every skill.
-Storytelling is very compelling and feels really good to experience.
-Character's backstories in game, just awesome.

The bad:
-Everything is too slow: combats, transitions, animations, everything...
-Deathblow mechanic on enemies: just WHY? It's dumb, it's not creative and has a great synergi with the fact that →
-Every single enemy is a DMG sponge now, I don't care what eldritch bullshit you try to sell me... Every. Single. Enemy. Is a repository of DMG-Spongebob Eldritchpants with different art.
-It's drudgery. It's boring. I managed to reach the second boss after 15h of exploring (I like to take my time running in circles) what the game could offer me and I would find reading the telephone guide a more engaging and endearing activity.
-Every enemy skill does like 4 different things at once, and all the same: combo of dodge+counter or double stack of armor. All contributes to making the combat longer, taxing the players soul.
-I deluded myself thinking that DD2 was a bit more forgiving than DD1, boy I was wrong. Memories mechanic. Just that, it's bullshit that if you DONT COMPLETE THE RUN you lose everything you invested on that character's memories. No safe retreat for you, player. What. In. The. F*ck.
-Minibosses. Skip them, not worth the time, not worth the loot, and definetly not worth spending 20-30 minutes punching a  ~200HP trash bag that will meltdown your team 3 times and F up your run even if you win.

Not gonna mention RNG, this game is supposed to be hard and unfair, and thats its charm. The problem is that it's SLOW and BORING. Plainly Boring.

It's repetitive drudgery, and despite the lovely moments the storytelling has given me, which I enjoyed inmensely with the worldbuilding and the art, combat is still boring and slow.

This game needs major changes, or maybe it's just not for me.",0
138233928,1940340,Different from the first but excellent in its own way.,1
138233724,1940340,"Controversial take, I actively enjoy the heavier rogue-like approach they took, just wish characters talked a little more rather than saying the same thing over and over",1
138233610,1940340,"Mechanically, this game seems much better than the Darkest Dungeon 1.  However, it consistently crashes when entering ""The Foetor"" area on Linux and on Steam Deck, and the second time it crashed on me, it deleted my profile, resulting in the loss of all progress (including meta progression).  This has been a known issue for at least six months and has still not been addressed.  This is highly frustrating and extremely disappointing.  Probably this wouldn't be an issue if they'd released a native Linux version like they did for DD1.",0
138233592,1940340,"in the first game, while having a lot of random elements the game still felt like you could take control, the challenge is learning the game and how to prepare for missions, which heroes to go with (for example heroes that uses a lot of bleed aren't going to be very useful against skeletons in the ruins) and how much equipment you might need depending on the mission size, when you are on a mission you need to know when to fold to minimize casualties and maximize loot and then when you get out give rehab for stress/quirks (and based of the quirks decide if it's worth the time and money and time to remove it)
here in 2 unless you beat the final boss of the run the only thing that seems to carry on between runs is candles to upgrade characters/inventory/etc and skill unlocks you find through story checkpoints, so even if everyone starts hating each other and slowly dying between each enemy encounter there is no reason to pull out (keep gambling) and there doesn't seem to be nearly as much you as the player can do to take control of the scenario except pick a party that has a good dynamic at the start
(of course I have only played 7ish hours at review so might change later if it grows on me but I'm not the biggest fan of the new gameplay style so far)",0
138232593,1547670,the game is very hard,1
138234246,1159690,"I really liked the game trailer and it seemed like a cool game to spend time on.
Though, it turned out to be pretty boring game with not just bugs, but lots of balance issue.
First of all, you can get good time playing this game for mb 4 hours - when you get not hard crafts, don't need to farm extensivelly everything u see and you can at least kill enemies.
Soon, the game turns into garbage with 3 main problems:
1. Enemies issues - they scale really fast, increasing their health, dmg, etc. You on the other hand get same modules for weapons which change nothing and you start omitting them mb from the 3 incounter. Moreover, AI of enemies in game is total failure - just aimbot which always hit you and see you. You can't run/hide, they always see you, always hit you even from the other end of map. Relly would like to have such aim in CS, but here it ruins the gameplay.
2. Resource management and research. It goes exponensially hard to craft anything. Moreover, unlike factorio/dyson sphere program, you can not just upgrade ur factory/tool/building to reduce space it requires. You will need smelter 1 for one types of resources, smelter 2 for second one. Why smelter lvl 2 can't make things smelter 1 does? Nobody knows (only devs)
3. Boring recourse farming. And here is the biggest problem. Even when you researched a lot and have this new crafting tools / recipes you must farm basic things like wood/scraps.

All in all, I totally don't recommend this game unless it becomes balanced any time in the future. For now it doesn't const its money, better to go to the cinema :/",0
138234216,1159690,"I have had this game on my wishlist for the last two years. I can say that i am certainly not disappointed. I have read many reviews for this game, mostly negative reviews. 
I am 100% sure that this is a case of people hating a game just to hate it. I'll address the common complaints. 

The game runs buttery smooth for an early access. Perfect 60 with that cell shaded indie look on a lot of good games. The game is basically Raft in space with a few unique differences. You swim out and gather resources while tethered to your personal train. You gather resources, craft different stations that provide different resources. The story i will admit is a bit vague but for games like this, you should expect that. It's simple yet it's done right. It kept me engaged to the point where i only stopped when i needed to eat or sleep. Now....onto the complaints        

1. the resource gathering is slow. 
I am currently 3 and a half hours in and I am on my 5th area and the resources are just as quick as when it started. May train size is tripled and gear consists of a gun, a grappling hook and a leather suit with an armor plate. The leather is a little difficult to come by. However, the leather spawns in containers inside Depots (checkpoint areas between resource gathering areas). in these Depot areas are vending machines that provides an easier access to the obscure leather. 

2. The multiplayer is buggy and faulty. 
It's early access which isn't an excuse. However, it is the reason why. The multiplayer function is dependent on the optimization of the game, it's servers and the gamer's PC. Like with raft, satisfactory and many others. The multiplayer will get better with updates. A legit complaint for a full release but a trivial complaint for early access. 

3. the gun-play is boring with repetitive enemies. 
Where to begin...First of all, the game didn't originally have guns or enemies at all. i have used both mouse and controller for shooting and the gun-play is smooth and buttery with both. Games like COD have no enemy variety and AI that makes the ""stormtroopers"" in Voidtrain look like strategic masters. The AAA rail shooter gets a pass but the Indie game with little budget and around 5 employees doesn't. 

I could go on but I am most likely reaching my character limit. Easy 8/10, if you're looking to scratch that survival resource gathering itch, i would recommend it.",1
138232110,1159690,"I found this game on the steam, watched the trailer and few videos about it and game is NUTS. Its just like the trailer you are on the train travelling trough the void collecting resources and fighting against mobs and other people in the void (NPC). There are guns and other stuff and game is not too grindy, its just right. If you like games like Rust, Minecraft, Ark survival evolved I definitely recommend this game to you. Not to mention that this game was released few days ago and its still in development so many more things are about to come and also there is co-op.",1

138233759,758690,"This game has good potential and very interesting gameplay, but the tutorials hardly work at all, the game is laggy and poorly optimized and becomes boring after a few hours. i know it's just a pre-release approach, but i've been waiting for this game for 3 years and it's a big disappointment for me.",0
138231959,758690,"The game concept is okay, but the gameplay is horrible! It is clunky and flimsy to the point that it is freaking annoying! No excuse for an Early Access game. It would be great if I could reload my save games. Wouldn't it? You know when I purchased this game I had no expectation and I am still disappointed! It's that bad! Agggrh! Please don't keep any high hopes!",0
138234100,2369390,"It's worth to buy if only there's a discount, which is right now. I just love skill points, it feel weird that now I need to choose which gear is good for my run. I hope the next game will bring skill points back.
It's a good game tbh, but not the best one, because the last game I was played in this series is Far Cry 3.

138235551,1494420,So this game is very rough. However for 20$ i would say it's very worth it. The game is very clunky but it reminds me of command and conquer renegade x. The controls are simple and the map is HUGE. I would say the map needs to be half as much as it is now. The commander Role seems awesome. You can actively control an army and also build vehicles for in game players to use. You can influence the whole game as a commander and as a ground troop. This is something unique to the game and really no other game does it. However the con of the game commander is if they are New or Suck your probably gonna loose. Neat game can't wait to see what else comes from it.,1

However, if there is one gripe that I do have with one character is Coco. Her hit-boxes for her fliping-command grab is a bit weird in that you can't insta trigger it unlike her dino grab, her 1-meter tail special, while I understand is a mid-air grab, has ,what feels like, a really small hitbox.

In addition, the special is really weird in that it doesn't have a tail smack hit-box if you miss the grab, contrary to the animation. The lack of a reliable somewhat close/mid-range super really hurts her approaches since she's a close range fighter like Tager or susanoo from BlazBlue, only both characters have options to fight against zoners and speedsters.",1
138235359,2322660,Truy kích :)),1
138235975,1940340,"Overall I've found the game to be a disappointment. The flow of the first game has been abandoned for a Hades-esque format where you're in a constant restart loop. Instead of the first game where you are simply dropped in and left to figure it out you are now spoon fed access to everything on a slow drip as EVERYTHING is gated behind shops to be unlocked. 

The maps themselves are also a huge step backwards. The suspense of each unscouted tile being a trap or encounter as you inch forward is gone. There is exactly one event between ""rooms"" now and you always have a choice between paths now. Because there are no true surprises waiting for you you spend a lot of time just waiting for your cart to plod down the path. I find a large part of the gameplay is just spent waiting and wishing I had a turbo button to get through the constant repetition. All the fun dialogue and character interactions to take the edge off of the repetition in Hades is completely absent here. 

I've generally found the UI to be a mess. From the outset I was just met with confusion. The frequency with which there are icons on screen that you can't hover over for a tooltip is way too high. Far too much of the information requires holding additional buttons CTRL or ALT to access stuff which isn't always accessible depending on what screen or event you're on. The games ability to present information during the natural flow of gameplay is poor. 

Skill unlocks are slow going and make it impossible to evaluate characters or comps early on. Nor is there a way I've found to determine in game what order you unlock things or even what you unlock until you've committed to a shrine. Having an endless list of things that require candles but having little way of determining what should or should not be prioritized because it's all obfuscated is a major complaint. A prime offender I found was the class paths. Switching from Wanderer to Confessor for the first time. It simply says ""Rank Flexible roll that specializes in debuff and token removal."" It's just flavor text to give you a vague idea of what it does instead of simply presenting you with the changes. They've bothered to add a list of the skills effected by the path but not to add tool tips to view the changes and evaluate before purchase. All trinkets and items have been relegated to individual unlock. No indication if it's ordered progression or just random.

The presentation is a step up. The game does look better and I found myself enjoying the 3d transition far more than expected as my initial reaction to it was rather negative. The animations as characters move between ranks to be an excellent addition that brings life to the combat.

The actual combat remains mostly the same as DD1. Debuffs no longer last for some amount of time but instead are consumed when they are rolled for. Blind for instance gives you a 50% chance to miss on your next attack and will stick around until you make an attack so you can't just wait it out by using support skills and I've enjoyed the change. Stress is triggers affliction or virtue at 10 and resets instead of trigger at 100 and heart attack at 200.  Instead of having a myriad of different affects for Afflictions and Virtues we now only get good or bad. You either lose a bunch of health and get negative relationship points or you get a big heal and gain relationship points. So far I've found the relationship system to be pretty obnoxious with little way of interacting with it. Hopefully that changes later in the game as more items/trinkets are unlocked to interact with relationship points. 

Overall I'm pretty unhappy with most out of combat changes and the relationship system. I'd have much preferred they stick to the format that made DD1 so successful and continue to build on that. I think the Hades approach has detracted from what made the first one special.",0
138235684,1940340,"Very fun, less grind than DD1 and every run is a new challenge. High recommend if you like roguelikes",1
138235305,1940340,beats me down just as much as the first game,1
138235164,1940340,"(300+ hours on DD1)

This isn't a game-play sequel, this is a story sequel.

The combat has been updated and improved since DD1. The new game-play loop is both more engaging AND rewarding. losses aren't the same, but having a party member die is still devastating at times.

The candle system is basic, but passable. 

I'm highly enjoying the game.",1
138235085,1940340,"Hi there,
as many of you i am a great fan of the first game.
As many of you, i immediately felt something is off in this second chapter.
While in the first game you had to slowly build your town and your heroes to eventually enter the final dungeon, in DD2 you just embark on an expedition with 4 characters, and once that expedition is over, you go for the next one.
You dont' get to keep your heroes, you dont' get to keep any trinkets, you don't keep anything. After finishing a run (either beating the boss or team whipe) you get an amount of candles that you can spend to make your future runs easier.
This is still something, as it gives some sense of satisfaction, but after a dozen of runs it already started to feel annoying.
One of the best aspect of the first game was the care and attention you needed to give to your characters: you had your favourites one, with their perks you spent hours and gold to get, with your preferred trinkets choice. It was a great feeling venturing forth with your veterans knowing that yes, with them you had a slight edge on enemies, but things could still end up in disaster. All this feeling is now gone: sometimes if a run is disappointing me (i.e. bad perks, bad relationship) i just find  it's better to end it there. I get my candles, i start a new one and hope for the best. I think this defies the very essence of the 1st game, where no matter what you struggled to get the best ouf of every dungeon expedition, because you spent gold, time, resources on that run and on those caracters.
The graphic is now good, but i find this game as A LOT of dead moments: the combat animations takes so long, riding the carriage is pointless because you just have to press W and wait for the next encounter.
The core gameplay is still solid: combat is fun and brutal
Art direction is still on point, but even in this case something is off: it's weird that every run has the same scenarios put together in a random order. It makes it seems like there's no real sense around the story: what are theese scenarios? Why the city is in flame? Why the hell am i going toward the mountain?
I'm playing the game, i think it's ok, but the price was too high (even with the discount, i feel 30 bucks for a downgrade of the 1st game is way too much).
I feel like the devs tried to make this more appealing to a larger fane base: i hope this will give them the means to make something great in the future, but i also feel like the original fanbase was a bit ignored.
If you are new to DD, maybe this could be a good way to start getting involved. Other than that, play the first one.

138236569,1159690,"I find it very exhausting to always have to gather loot and smelt everything, then use the research table to make a blueprint and after, gather the rescourses and build it. This game have A LOT to craft and most of this becomes more and more expensive. I have spent most of my time really only smelting and gathering loot rather than do whats really fun, fighting and building my own custom train. 

My train right now is just a long organized ''mess'' because the storage chest are very small and the bigger ones are more expensive and kinda not really worth it in my opinion. You also need to have the different worktables, smelters, labs in each stage. You can't remove smelter 1 and only use 2. Thats what I thought because it would make sense to make that better and faster, but not really, it is just another smelter that let you smelt something different that you would later need.

So right now, I can play the game in 20-30 minutes intervalls because I get so exhausted always have to loot, smelt, wait, craft, research, wait, craft and boom. The engine is also very expensive and does not go fast for a long time. Also everything gets damaged very fast and some are a bit too expensive to repair. 

The winch system with the hooks could be more frequent and faster, now it feels ''blocky'' and kinda off. I was kinda hoping for a seamless spiderman feel but it feels more of something thats really not finish.

The game is quite okay and a lowkey meh, in my opinion. I see a lot of potential in this game but right now it is more boring and meh faster than actually fun, it is just too much to do and craft for a very long period.

Right now the game is more suitable for multiplayer than singleplayer.
Would I recommend this game to other players? I would say yes and no, it really depends. I couldn't leave something in the middle so I went with yes, I can really tell that they have been working hard on this game.",1
138234967,1159690,It is a great game to play with friends. Has some grind but gets better as you go. Very atmospheric. There are some bugs since it just came out but the devs are on it.,1

The graphics are good
The narrator and story are interesting.
The gameplay is fun and engaging.
World and creatures are cool.
Gunplay and combat is a little lacking, it feels clunky, and so does the UI around combat and enemies. Devs have already made a note to improve it, and it's honestly not a deal-breaker.

As it stands, the bugs and clunky gunplay hinder what is an otherwise entertaining and new take on survival games. Nevertheless, it's still enjoyable and feels fresh!

138234389,669330,"This is such a cool take on the autobattler. I learned about this from esty8nine's stream and have been having a blast in the open beta and now in EA. 

It's quick to pick up, takes no more than 10-15 minutes to play a match, but gives you a ton of interesting decisions to make with every round. There's never enough money to do everything you want, which means there are always opportunities to exploit in your opponent's defences. The unit balance is really good - every unit has a niche, and building an army is not just a matter of rock-paper-scissors - upgrades, formations, and skills/abilities all make a huge difference.",1
138237152,2369390,"The good : It's better than the horrible FC5 and New Dawn.
The bad : it's still only mediocre and suffers from bad balancing. 

Constant animal attacks interrupt everything (while setting up an ambush on a base I got attacked by no less than 12 alligators. Even when you shoot them with a silencer it still alerts all guards. Happened 4 times in 10 hours of gameplay so far.)
Combat is boring. The game doesn't like stealth/sniping, as it tries very hard to make it as frustrating as possible. All too often, it ends in bang-boom-bang-explosions-everywhere. The available weapons are very much geared towards that. Which means that 80/90% of them are plain useless for a sniper.

As usually there are way too many and too long cutscenes, but that's just FC.

I recommend getting it on a big discount only.",1

138236955,2369390,"Why though? It's good to find a formula people recognize and enjoy. It's good to create a somewhat new storyline and concept to be the backing to all the gaming going on. It's good to try to innovate new ideas into your game. ...But which one of you mooks said, 'You know what this game needs? No healing items! We'll just make it so the player can only heal over time, and has to regnerate their heal charges, which will be all sorts of over the top animations, like using pliers to rip the fresh slugs from their flesh!'? Who said, 'You know those jetski races we had? You know what they need? MINES IN THE WATER. And you know what else? Lets retool the way they handle to be twice as slippery as before, steer from the back instead of the front, and only either be full throttle or barely moving! Egh? EGH?!' Who felt the game shouldn't start at the beginning, and instead require you to play through an extra long introductory cutscene before the game started... and then give you absolutely everything everywhere to do at once? Who's ideas were these? BECAUSE THEY'RE HORRIBLE IDEAS. 
As soon as I reached the 'beginning' of the game, I was buried in stuff and lost. I had races against time; except they had enemy troops at the end after beating them that then swarmed me to death, resetting it all. I had missions come up as I was trying to return to the starting point (why didn't you just allow someone doing this quest to restart at the starting point? Why some random, far off location that was almost guaranteed to pull them off and sidetrack them?) and then those missions escalated to the point of me having to lay hidden in a bush from special forces for 20 minutes (I wasn't going to do the mission; I just peeked in the seemingly empty area, only for it to explode with enemies, and helicopters and snipers with perfect aim who were also completely in cover).
I admit that maybe I was a little tired as I played, but I was having decent fun playing the beginning. Then suddenly I couldn't find any focus; not the main thread of the story, not hunting, not farming resources, NOTHING... because every time I turned around once and tried to focus, my radio would go off again. 'Can you do THIS!? Can you do THAT?! I know I gave you five freakin other starter missions that are going to require you to liberate the entire map... but can ya?!' The 'race' was the icing that made me write this negative review cake though. I made the first few turns, and was wondering where the mines were as I coasted through. Then I realized ALL of those yellow orbs in the water were mines. ALL of them. Where the hell did they get all those mines?! And they all one shot you too! So if you make one mistakes, race over, start from the beginning? Aw, HEELLLL naw!
The game, on the surface, is fun. I LOVED Far Cry Primal and Far Cry New Sawn, and was eager for more in a new world, with maybe some new story and cutscenes. And now I'm going to have to teach myself to not look away from the main quests or I'm going to regret it.Or is it maybe stop trying to look at the main quests?  There comes a point in a game where just layering the difficulty does nothing for the game, and this feels like that; like the devs or producers tried to cram all the MORE into the game, and left it almost too full of things that need doing.",0

I began this game on realistic difficulty with all of the assists turned off, and although it's been very challenging, the learning process has actually been quite fun. This particular game requires so much concentration that I've found it to be incredibly easy to lose myself in it, and because of that I've found this to be very relaxing to just zone out to.

Though I do recommend this game, there are two things I don't like about it. The scenery in this game kind of flickers as you go by and it can be incredibly distracting. I've adjusted my settings multiple times and have yet to mitigate this issue. There's also ZERO customization in this game, you have a list of professional racers to choose from and that's who you will play as throughout the season.

Aside from the two things listed above, this game is solid. This is my first sportbike game in ages and it's been humbling to play. Find me on Twitch if you'd like to see me struggle to go fast. xD",1

Constant animal attacks interrupt everything (while setting up an ambush on a base I got attacked by no less than 12 alligators. Even when you shoot them with a silencer it still alerts all guards. Happened 4 times in 10 hours of gameplay so far.)
Combat is boring. The game doesn't like stealth/sniping, as it tries very hard to make it as frustrating as possible. All too often, it ends in bang-boom-bang-explosions-everywhere. The available weapons are very much geared towards that. Which means that 80/90% of them are plain useless for a sniper.

As usually there are way too many and too long cutscenes, but that's just FC.

138236955,2369390,"Why though? It's good to find a formula people recognize and enjoy. It's good to create a somewhat new storyline and concept to be the backing to all the gaming going on. It's good to try to innovate new ideas into your game. ...But which one of you mooks said, 'You know what this game needs? No healing items! We'll just make it so the player can only heal over time, and has to regnerate their heal charges, which will be all sorts of over the top animations, like using pliers to rip the fresh slugs from their flesh!'? Who said, 'You know those jetski races we had? You know what they need? MINES IN THE WATER. And you know what else? Lets retool the way they handle to be twice as slippery as before, steer from the back instead of the front, and only either be full throttle or barely moving! Egh? EGH?!' Who felt the game shouldn't start at the beginning, and instead require you to play through an extra long introductory cutscene before the game started... and then give you absolutely everything everywhere to do at once? Who's ideas were these? BECAUSE THEY'RE HORRIBLE IDEAS. 
As soon as I reached the 'beginning' of the game, I was buried in stuff and lost. I had races against time; except they had enemy troops at the end after beating them that then swarmed me to death, resetting it all. I had missions come up as I was trying to return to the starting point (why didn't you just allow someone doing this quest to restart at the starting point? Why some random, far off location that was almost guaranteed to pull them off and sidetrack them?) and then those missions escalated to the point of me having to lay hidden in a bush from special forces for 20 minutes (I wasn't going to do the mission; I just peeked in the seemingly empty area, only for it to explode with enemies, and helicopters and snipers with perfect aim who were also completely in cover).
I admit that maybe I was a little tired as I played, but I was having decent fun playing the beginning. Then suddenly I couldn't find any focus; not the main thread of the story, not hunting, not farming resources, NOTHING... because every time I turned around once and tried to focus, my radio would go off again. 'Can you do THIS!? Can you do THAT?! I know I gave you five freakin other starter missions that are going to require you to liberate the entire map... but can ya?!' The 'race' was the icing that made me write this negative review cake though. I made the first few turns, and was wondering where the mines were as I coasted through. Then I realized ALL of those yellow orbs in the water were mines. ALL of them. Where the hell did they get all those mines?! And they all one shot you too! So if you make one mistakes, race over, start from the beginning? Aw, HEELLLL naw!
The game, on the surface, is fun. I LOVED Far Cry Primal and Far Cry New Sawn, and was eager for more in a new world, with maybe some new story and cutscenes. And now I'm going to have to teach myself to not look away from the main quests or I'm going to regret it.Or is it maybe stop trying to look at the main quests?  There comes a point in a game where just layering the difficulty does nothing for the game, and this feels like that; like the devs or producers tried to cram all the MORE into the game, and left it almost too full of things that need doing.",0

138236975,1924170,"I Have genuinely enjoyed  playing this game, but I will admit that if you can wait for a sale, I would definitely do that. $50 is a bit steep in my honest opinion. I don't think that this game will have much longevity to it.

I began this game on realistic difficulty with all of the assists turned off, and although it's been very challenging, the learning process has actually been quite fun. This particular game requires so much concentration that I've found it to be incredibly easy to lose myself in it, and because of that I've found this to be very relaxing to just zone out to.

Though I do recommend this game, there are two things I don't like about it. The scenery in this game kind of flickers as you go by and it can be incredibly distracting. I've adjusted my settings multiple times and have yet to mitigate this issue. There's also ZERO customization in this game, you have a list of professional racers to choose from and that's who you will play as throughout the season.

Aside from the two things listed above, this game is solid. This is my first sportbike game in ages and it's been humbling to play. Find me on Twitch if you'd like to see me struggle to go fast. xD",1
138234865,1924170,"Here's a recipe for Beef Wellington:

Ingredients:
- 1 (2-pound) beef tenderloin
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1/2 pound mushrooms, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup chopped shallots
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup dry white wine
- 1/4 cup beef broth
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
- 1 sheet puff pastry, thawed
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
2. Season the beef tenderloin with salt and pepper.
3. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the beef and sear on all sides until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and let cool.
4. Spread the Dijon mustard over the cooled beef tenderloin.
5. In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, shallots, and garlic and cook until the mushrooms are browned and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
6. Add the white wine, beef broth, and thyme to the skillet and cook until the liquid has reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
7. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mushroom mixture cool.
8. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
9. Spread the mushroom mixture over the puff pastry.
10. Place the beef tenderloin on top of the mushroom mixture.
11. Wrap the puff pastry around the beef tenderloin, making sure to seal the edges.
12. Brush the beaten egg over the top of the puff pastry.
13. Place the Beef Wellington on a baking sheet and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the puff pastry is golden brown and the beef tenderloin is cooked to your liking.
14. Let the Beef Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

138238905,2272420,"I never played the first [i]Thief Simulator[/i] so here I cannot make a comparison. However, I did try [i]American Theft 80s[/i] which - similarly to this game - had a completely free prologue version to play before the game was officially released. The similarities between the two games are many - except this is played from the first person and it is a modern take on a thief's life (as the other software took us back to the '80s).

[i]Thief 2[/i] puts in a small suburban area and we are tasked with various burglary missions - all accepted via our computer in our hideout. This is a separate location accessible once we leave the suburbs. We can commute between the two locations at will. Going ""home"" will be mandatory to continue the story and to pick up additional missions. A good thing is the option to use our mobile to purchase items on the spot (such as tools for lockpicking if we run out).

This prologue is a bit misleading in the sense that it gives you a lot of residential buildings but some are inaccessible as it is not the full game. You also see texts highlighted in red telling you what skills you'd need to use to - for instance - access the vents but some of these will probably be available only in the full game. It's a good ad, however, it begs the question how far you can go in the prologue. I'm already done with the story part (as the achievement popped) but I have some more missions to complete and skills to purchase.

But what can you steal in [i]Thief 2[/i]? Pretty much everything: kitchen appliances, vintage wine and bigger objects such as TVs or paintings that require the use of your car. Your vehicle, by the way, has a box that allows you to store 15 kgs of stuff in addition to the 15 kg you can put in your backpack. Once done you can head back to your hideout and check if anything special was requested by [i]BlackBay[/i]. If not, just got to the pawnshop and sell everything you have. As you make progress you'll learn to lockpick, hide and even to escape from the police. You can purchase intel to make a mission easier - it is recommended to spy first and find out when the owners of a propriety leave for the day. To make time pass fast you can sleep in your car but only in car parks.

Overall, I was satisfied with [i]Thief 2[/i], I have to admit, though, [i]American Theft[/i] had a better impression on me. Perhaps this is related to the '80s and to the fact that this prologue offers a very barebone story. No cutscenes just a contact telling us what to do; all the theft in order to ensure our debt is repaid to the mafia. Still, this is a neat little game that offers a couple of hours' playtime and it is completely free of charge.",1

138238254,2167340,"4/10 An app that demonstrates Unity physics engine in 3 scenes.

Note: press Tab to see controls. You can't really throw objects (only if you rotate while holding an object and release it while still rotating you will throw it a short distance like a mini-trebuchet).

Good:
- free
- scene 3 is actually fun for a while: you can jump down huge ramps. If you've been to an AquaPark that's a pretty similar feeling

So-so:
- no sfx at all
- music is a bit boring
- objects have simplistic looks and use a couple similar textures though the cubes have a nice white glow around the edges

Bad:
- well, essentially no gameplay. The game is just 3 scenes with cubes placed in them + some 3D models like tables and bookcases. You can pick them up, move to topple down stacks of cubes and right click to jump forward. All of this is simply the functionality of the engine, so I'm not sure what the author's role is apart from simply placing the 3D objects.

Btw why are all words capitalized in the description? Anyways, it's an app that can be fun for a couple minutes. But it's simply not enough to be a game. And without a button to throw objects it's not even much fun as a sanbdox. So it's rather a downvote.

Safe to say i'm impressed.
Some of the first cutscenes could do some work sure, but overall its everything farcry 5 was and more. The supremo ability... I won't spoil the entire game but it is fun.

BUT at this early access  stage at least it is way too easy and this is coming from player who has played hockey games last time in 1995. The roguelite progression seems totally unnecessary as you can win the game easily without any upgrades.

I played 4 times to win in standard difficulty. That is not what game that has roguelite progression should be like. After that I changed to expert and still got to second to last match with my fist game.

There needs to be some random stacking difficulty modifier that makes all the matches harder and harder in addition to the more skillful opponents. Like ""angry fans"" or ""haters"" that throw stuff at your players or otherwise hamper your game.

- gameplay is brain-dead, bugged and laggy. 
The first minigame asks you to click on flying symbols and drag them into correct buckets. This would be simple enough but this minigame lags like hell. I'm sure it's just awful programming there because there are just a dozen 2D sprites on the screen which any computer should be able to handle at max fps
The second and third minigame aren't really minigames because you can't affect the flying symbols on the screen and instead simply press one of 3 buttons to feed the child, wash it or read a book to it, to prevent the Sims-like bars from reaching zero. Each such action costs in-game money. But you don't see how much money you have or even how it's earned! You only find out that there is not enough money when you try to buy something and hear an error sound. Ridiculous
The third minigame asks you to drag some items on a wheel - again, this stage lags horribly and was stuck for me until I don't even know what I did and it resumed
I exited the game at that point, so maybe there is more variety there but I didn't have any hope left and gave up
- English localization is atrocious and it's hard to understand the instructions to these minigames, increasing confusion even more

138243273,1940340,"This game takes one step forward and two steps back. It has added so much more gameplay mechanics and customization and then has bad game mechanics to take back any enjoyment you have from it.


- The most egregious fault of this game is taking away player Agency by adding requirements to skills. for example: target has to have less than 25% health to use healing skill, ""oh you have 26% health? Too bad nerd, you don't get to use that.""
          Ex2:  less than 50% to be healed from this effect or else only the primary effect is used. which wouldn't be so bad on one healing skill, but ALL healing skills are like this.

- Everything gets a chance to not die (death's door) on reducing health to zero, enemies and you. The game is already hard enough why add this, or why not add this as a customization. ""all enemies now have Death Door chance for x2 reward bonus"" or something like that. Base game should not have that as an active mechanic.

- Stun no longer skips turns, it just delays to the end. There is very little use for this, why have it in the game at that point or just call it something else. Everyone who has played the first game knows stun to be something different, to change it into something lesser is not an improvement to the game.

- Bad Game mechanics that just frustrate and don't amount to enjoyable experience. boss giving themselves x3 (50%) dodge every turn they don't start with it while pouring status effects all over your team isn't enjoyable.


***  This game should be a resource management and strategy game where you are having a turn-based battle of attrition with an endless enemies. It should play like a game that despite all odds you can pull a win with great gamesmanship and experience, but what you get is a game you roll the of the dice and win despite the game's functionality.  ***


I want to like this game so much, but this one doesn't scratch the itch. I will just stick with the old Darkest Dungeon unless something drastically changes with this game. It was almost there and forgot to stick the landing.

138243106,1940340,"I can't recommend this game, it breaks my heart as I loved the first game and over 1,500 hours in it across Steam and my Switch.

I think there is a good game in here somewhere but it's just too frustrating to play and woefully unbalanced.  Absolutely everything seems to be designed to irritate and punish the player to the point where I question why Red Hook think people play games, I, like most other people I assume, play a game to have fun and there is very little fun to be had here.

Whilst DD1 was probably a bit too weighted in the player's favour once you figured it out, DD2 has gone far too far in the other direction.  If a game has 100 tutorials in it's glossary, it might be that you've made it too complicated... but that aside, there are things that just seem overpowered, enemies constantly blocking and dodging is irritating enough, but when those enemies constantly heal the ones you can hit, combat can become very tedious.  Whilst your deathblow resistances seem to be a lie, I've lost count of the number of times a unit has died on the first deathblow hit despite having around a 70% chance of surviving.

If you enjoyed the first game you might like this, it's not all bad by any means, I love the Slay the Spire style maps, the sound design is spot on again (of course aided by Wayne June), the plot is promising and the way some units (in particular the Vestal for me) have had their skills re-designed is impressive.  But ultimately I'm always battling to have fun with the game, it shouldn't be this hard to find enjoyment in a game.",0

138241844,1940340,"This is a sequel like no other that I've played and i love it. 
What most sequels will do is either take 95% of the original game and barely change anything about it, making those who've invested their time and love with the original title feel like there is no point in returning to an 'outdated' version, while bringing nothing truly new to the table. Maybe new graphics and balance changes that could've just been added to the first. OR the sequel tries too hard to capture the magic of the original while completely ruining the feel that it gave to the original of the series.

Red hook has done a genius way of taking the brutal unforgiving combat that MADE the original, while still giving a new experience for old and new players of the series to enjoy. 

While the first game was focused on YOU the player, reclaiming a lost town from ruin and building it up from depravity in order to conquer anything in your path. The heroes are simply *tools* in order to complete your objective. Even with those you've spent time training to the highest level, you couldn't really get attached to them because the game made you KNOW you could lose them at any point. 

The second game however really puts the spotlight on the intriguing characters of the first. Diving deep into their back stories of what made them who they are, giving each character a unique personality and REASON to care for them. Instead building up the town so that recruits wouldn't be such a burden, you focus on making each character stronger with every run, finding new character paths and items that allow you to combine different strategies between the others without being heavily punished for simply experimenting.

It does a perfect job of sticking to its root in what made the first so enjoyable while still introducing new mechanics and game-play to not only draw in new players for a brutal yet re-playable experience, but also giving the veterans of D.D. a new feel of a lovable title. 

Its nice to have a sequel to a game that doesn't make you wanna stop playing the first. Their both very different from each other but thats good. 

If you want a Hard game play this one
If you want a BRUTAL game, play the first.

138240619,1940340,"Whoever redesigned the healing system is a fucking moron. The difficulty is artificial at all points throughout because of this moronic token system and healing being capped for zero reason. Whatever these devs were smoking when they made DD2, ima need some of it.",0
138241053,1730250,"SUMMARY: A fun, easy-to-start, hard-to-master puzzle game where you build a landscape by aligning tiles, unlocking new buildings, and meeting challenges.  Pan'orama is a great fusion very much in the style of Dorfromantik and Islanders, that should probably be in your library if this is your jam.

Pan'orama is part of that slow-building buy enjoyable genre of ""envoronment-builder puzzles"" we've been blessed with over the years - Islanders, Dorfromantik, the Metro series, etc.  That genre could always use more entries, and Pan'orama is a worthy one.

You have a deck of environment tiles in random order - and you know the next few that are coming.  Align tiles right and you get points, and build an environment that generates more points.  Get enough points and you get buildings that will add new tiles, features, or increase scores.  As you play ""challenge"" tiles will appear that grant you more points for adding specific tile types.  How long can you keep going and what kind of wolrd will you build.

The core of the game is it's interaction - you can line up all sorts of combinations to keep going, and because you're ""thinking"" on a 2D board and about the influences of certain buildings, it adds noteable challenge.  It's never completely overwhelming, but you'll need to think now and then.  Nothing is unclear, more the interactive elements start to come together.

All of this is done in a charming presentation of chill music and nice graphics.  Be sure to zoom in on your landscape to catch all sorts of cute details!

So is the game good?  Yes, it's very good.  If you at all enjoyed any of its predecessors you'll love it.  Plus the game can go longer when you get into the zone, so it avoids some of the frustration of short, sudden failures.

If there's a flaw it's that Pan'orama feels less innovative and more a ""polishing"" of previous formulas, especially Dorfromantik.  You won't see anything new here, just what came before done very, very well.  That's no reason not to buy the game, of course.

So if you liked what you've seen in this genre, grab Pan'orama.  It's worth it.",1

(Attention to the word ""survival"" because the game becomes dark, friends. Be careful!) The dialogues are fun and the protagonist is certainly one of the best characters in the game! WHAT A BADASS! I played three routes (Peter, Garth and Tom) and I'm going to the fourth (Poptart) and I can already say that I RECOMMEND this game! So let's get to the routes...

And the first route played was Peter's. Peter is a controversial guy that you want to kiss and punch at the same time, he may be a little shit but there's no denying he's charming. Even though I didn't like the way he and the protagonist got together (you have to respect girl code, as Susie said) and how he broke up with Felicity (I mean, that was a big no no), he managed to redeem himself in the final chapters. <3 In the end, the route was very sweet and we found out that he is a romantic and protective guy. I like characters that evolve over the course of the story and I think Peter has great character development. In short, he managed to make me completely fall in love.

Garth's route was the second one I did and … wow, I definitely DIDN'T EXPECT this one![spoiler]I was curious to know how he had just disappeared in Peter's route and here we find out what happened[/spoiler] Poor Garth! In fact, I particularly recommend leaving this route for the finale, as it can give you anxiety about playing the final route. It's also pretty short as it ends in Chapter 6 (for reasons I can't reveal).

The next one was… Tom. If in Peter's route the romance already starts in the first chapters, in this route things only unfold towards the end. Tom's route is like a ""common route"" with several characters appearing and helping you. It really represents ""friendship""! As for the romance... well, those who like friends to lovers will like it, it's a cute route and has several flashbacks to how they met and became friends. I haven't played all the routes yet, but it's almost like this is the ""true route"" (as much as I don't like that term).

138243246,2369390,"Eh. I'd recommend this game at the $15 dollars I paid, but I'm doing thumbs down because it is NOT worth the full asking of $60. It's like any other farcry game, except it's slightly worse than farcry 5. Animations are wonky, gunplay is SO much worse than nearly every other FPS game out there (mw2, apex, Bf2042, counter strike, etc), too much running around with no purpose, etc. 

This game is really a time sink. Rewarding one? Meh.

It's also not very.... believable? 75% of soldiers are women (or trans women), 95% of leaders are women (or trans women), a real rebellion would not have a ratio like that, men would be doing most of the fighting. This is not sexist, this is simply stating that the environment of the game is very fictional and keeps me from getting immersed. Previous Farcry titles are fairly immersible, and this one sticks out as not.

Crafting in games is generally good. However, this game just has it as a grind and the crafting is very simplistic. Your weapons get at most, 3 attachments, and it's usually ""ammo"" , ""sight"" , ""muzzle."" - of which you have 2 or 3 choices between them and that's it. Man, it's 2023. Not 2011. The freaking crossbow on MW2 has more options for customization than every gun on this game combined. That's on top that the gun-feel sucks. Just... ubisoft is NOT good at making FPS games apart from Rainbow 6, and I hope they stop making FPS games. Stick to stuff you're good at like more games like AC Odyssey. This isn't it.

138242330,2349830,"This game is too barebones to recommend in its current state, and what's there needs a lot of work.

The inventory system is an interesting idea, but unfortunately as implemented the game quickly turns into a mess of random effects with no clear feedback on each weapon's effectiveness.  Each character starts with a weapon that's available from the random item pool, but since that weapon is not on the grid it is not eligible for the spell card combinations.  There's no other distinction between the characters, and since weapon balance is also poorly tuned, some characters like Remilia are immediately at a significant disadvantage to fight off the swarm of fairies at the start.  This is exacerbated by XP / money pickups despawning shortly after dropping, meaning you have little time to pick them up after kiting enemies away.

Focus movement is questionable in its current form, even if it is obviously a nod to Touhou.  You don't control when your weapons activate; they fire on their own individual timers, and many weapons fire in the direction you are facing.  While Focus lets you hold aim, it slows you down significantly.  Enemies quickly start moving faster than you do regardless of Focus, so you will rarely have time to use this before your more useful weapons fire; spell cards such as Master Spark often get aimed in a random direction because you're too busy running away when it happens to activate.  Other games in this genre (like 20MTD, Touhou Library Survivors, etc) let you control when to fire your weapons which works much better with this kind of mechanic.

The UX also needs work; cannot return to main menu from the character select screen, item tooltips only visible by holding down Q while hovering over the item (why not just show the tooltip on hover?), item descriptions are vague, and I initially did not realize that using a weapon horizontally or vertically meant rotating the weapon while dragging it in the inventory grid.  Weapons are shown in game as a bunch of small icons in the corner with cooldown timers that are difficult to read at a glance.

Beyond all of that... there's just not much here to keep the player engaged.  The only stage is an open field with barely anything on it, the enemies are all generic or forgettable Touhou fare, etc.  If there are any boss enemies I did not encounter them.  There are achievements in game but they are not linked to Steam for some reason.  Money is only used to unlock characters, but as mentioned previously this makes no difference outside of the opening minutes.  Simply put you have no reason to play this more than once.

Overall, I don't see myself playing this again.  Maybe I'll check back in a few months to see if anything changed.",0

The inventory system is an interesting idea, but unfortunately as implemented the game quickly turns into a mess of random effects with no clear feedback on each weapon's effectiveness.  Each character starts with a weapon that's available from the random item pool, but since that weapon is not on the grid it is not eligible for the spell card combinations.  There's no other distinction between the characters, and since weapon balance is also poorly tuned, some characters like Remilia are immediately at a significant disadvantage to fight off the swarm of fairies at the start.  This is exacerbated by XP / money pickups despawning shortly after dropping, meaning you have little time to pick them up after kiting enemies away.

Focus movement is questionable in its current form, even if it is obviously a nod to Touhou.

There are six lounges to hang out in, each with different theme, party activity and music.  There are multiple servers to login into.  You can invite friends or just try Random servers.    

CONS: Nobody is playing this. 

Maybe try this free game out.",1

138241023,1559600,"Played almost 4 hours so far and it's such a cute game! It's very relaxing and I love the whole vibe. I absolutely love a game that involves a lot of grinding towards stuff, you really need to keep at it to unlock more but it's great at keeping you busy. The auction side of it is a fantastic idea as I've already purchased horses with coats colours I wouldn't normally go for, so it's great for exploring new ideas. If I could add one little con I feel like it could be better at explaining how to unlock more, such as how to unlock more race courses and better horses but I assume that'll be made clear later but it would be nice to see what you're working towards. Other than that it's super fun!",1
